I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal

Carry me up them stairs,
Put my white socks on,
And my pretty song, you like,
My blue nail polish.
"What is all this?", you said,
"The mess upstairs,
Don't be scared"

Daddy dearest, you know,
How I like to take trips.
Pops first stop at the K-Mart,
Buy me my peach lipgloss,
Cigarettes and lolipops,
Mad magazines, and white socks.
All in your car for,
Our trip across the usa.

We gonna party,
Like it's 1949,
We in the Pontiac,
From July to July.

It's a flower motel nation,
Day and night on our last vacation,
We gonna see it all,
Before we say goodbye.

Daddy likes Blackpool,
Pleasure beach and roadstops,
Baby likes some Swiss Apps,
Souvenir giftshops.

Late night, midnight,
Radio show talks,
Daddy, baby,
Big jail break.

Ponytail and lolipops,
Dinerettes and sodapops.
New blue bathing suite,
Ruched tops and cadillacs.

Blue lake car to dunks,
Hop skotch, shit talk,
Alabama hard knocks,
Motel dresslocks.

We gonna party,
Like it's 1949,
We in the Pontiac,
From July to July.

It's a motel flower nation,
Day and night on our last vacation,
We gonna see it all,
Before he says goodbye

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you love

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you love

Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

You know it
And I know it
Gonna be a star
You won't, you won't
Get me very far.
Don't say hello, it's already time to go.

Oh, the wind is carrying me home, me home, me home again.

You know it
And I know it
Gonna be a star
You won't, you won't
Get me very far.
You saw life
Back in the countryside, a-a-a-a-ah.

Oh, my soul, rise up and go
Beyond, beyond
To what you know

I'm America's sweetheart
Tryin' to get away
You make heart delay, but it's easier for me
Stay, why I'm so afraid
And I had it up to here with the fightining
Baby we're not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear
So I'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L. A.
Never coming back no matter what you do I'll say
'Cuz I'm so afraid
And I had it up to here, with the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I can make it change
But I'm so afraid
But it's not love that keeps me here

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car, looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between a woman and a dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way, to come back from where you came

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear
So baby now I'm going back to Santa Monica, New York to L. A.
Never coming back no matter what you do I'll say
'Cuz I'm so afraid
And I had it up to here, with the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart
Boy I thought that I can make it change
But I'm so afraid
But it's not love it's just the fear
You've put down for all these years

But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica, New York to L. A.
Never coming back when no matter what you do I'll say
I am done beeing afraid

And I had it up to hill, with the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I can make it change
But I'm so afraid
Oh it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done beeing afraid
I am done beeing afraid
Oh oh oh

All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
May

I'm all smiles but inside I frown
Cause I've seen you walkin around with Betty Rue
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

How they're more fun than me, baby
I'm smiling then your jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So I watch you pull up your white coffee champagne
Let me get a better look at your face

I know it ain't noon
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

You're so fine, you're like Sikaru
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers

Yellow state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What does remain to you half full
When I have you
When I have you

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done

I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun
More fun…

Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your Crystal Method on
You were like, tall, tan, drivin' 'round the city
Flirtin' with the girls like, "You're so pretty."
"Springsteen is the king, don't you think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing."

Like ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-oh

Everybody wants to go fast
But they can't compare
I don't really want the rest
Only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying,
But I'm praying for you.

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh

Like an American

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh ooh-ooh

Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions, they will never understand
The kind of people you or I am, bow your heads and take your hands

They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?
You are California proud, you are angels of the night
Rock 'n' roll guardians now, the last keepers of the light
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
Paradise is a hell colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is the game of do or die
I just ride, ride, ride
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels
They were angels forever, forever angels

Back to the basics.
Trailer park love,
Wearing them asics,

You can sing for the neighbours,
You've been pretty stupid,
Ever since you got famous.

Of the tracks, boy.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only,
We'd go back, boy.

'Cause nobody does it like you,
I like the way that you move,
That's why I never go through,
With leaving you.

Everybody's sayin' that,
You're not good for me.
Your friends all swear,
That you've changed but,
I still keep it O. G.
This tune could be a reminder,
Of how it all used to be.
So shut up, and come on,
Sing our song.

And let's go back to the basics.

Back to the basics,
When you're not wasted,

Baby we could go,
Back to the basics, (c'mon),
We were best friends,
Crazy and shameless in love.

You can mow the lawn for money,
I can make you playlists.
You bought me dime packs,
Felt like we were famous.

Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I,
Ever had boy.
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you,
Remember that, boy?

Nobody knew what we knew,
We had it figured out too,
Us against the world just,
Me and you (ooh-ooh)!

We could leave it all and never look back.
If you wanted heaven, baby,
Sit back in my pink cadillac.

Everybody's sayin' that,
You're not good for me.
Your friends all swear,

He knows only I can save him tonight.

I've been waiting on your love,
Baby, for too long now, too long now.

Like the others but I don't know how,
Don't know how.

It's gonna backfire,
It's gonna backfire, baby.
Gonna backfire,
Gonna backfire, baby.

Told you one million times before,
You're so much firing a million more.

I'm tired of fighting you,
Seems like everything I do,
Even when I win I lose what you meant.
And it's not something you chose,
You say trouble follows you,
It's been like that since the day you began.

We got a jumper, got a jumper,
Got a jumper, got a jumper,

Well there's something about
Watching a crime
That makes me want to go out
And make it all mine
There's something about
Seeing your face
That makes me want to go out
Tonight
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true
There's something about
Seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home
Be Left alone
Someone make my mind up
So I don't have to decide
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do
There's some reason why
I can't sit still
Every waking moment

I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down
But I don't know how
Baby when I'm sleeping
It feels less like I am dreaming
Oh my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
There's a fear I have
A feeling real bad
I'm fine now if I find out that I'm not
I'll be sad
I try to quiet
Thoughts in the night
Oh they got me thinking
I'll be happier just drinking
It's not true
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please
Not even you

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to the house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi
But sometimes girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender

All the ladies of the canyon

Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden
And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach

Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)

Blue is the colour of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

But when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
(Let's not waste it, love)

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)

Yeah we've gotta try (lie-la-lie)
We gotta walk through fire (lie-la-lie)
Because we're just

Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
(Beautiful people)
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them

So beautiful
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey, 
Sing it to me, sing it to me]

You're so easy to love
You make me coo, coo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurt so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry

Cuz you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

Sunset on a Saturday night, 
Having a talk, talk bout the time of our lives.
He selling souls on the boulevard
Of broken dreams, and city queens

Live young like we oughta die fast
'Cause he's been breaking the law, and he's not going back
I love him finally all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you

You're a beautiful player baby
Ohh ohh oh ah ah ahh

L is for the love you that gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant, valiant baby
E is X that we took with champagne

Hit me and it felt like kiss
Baby, if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true loves more than he can give

'Cause he's my beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah
Cuz he's beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, yeah

On the streets of la
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody's watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can all get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold onto
For me, that was true love

I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in la
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying till she gets her way
(Like a true star)
There were roses in my hair,
Rock n roll on blare, and I was in trouble
And no one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils,
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene,
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all... Because... Of you

(You know what I'm talkin' about)

It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel,
But inside my heart was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)
But then I saw you standing there, like a millionaire
Give me a number, call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene,
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all... Because... Of you

It isn't hard to see, you got a hold on me,
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby, cause I'm so elated
You tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet

(I don't wanna lose it, I'm in love, but I didn't choose it)

Roses in my hair, dancing in the air, feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, makin' deal with devils like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene,
You bring me to my knees
And it's all... Because... Of you
Yeah it's all... Because... Of you

I like ‘em bad-bad, baby, you could be the one
And if you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me holy in the sky like a pizza pie

You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw it in the air and whoop like dynamite
Throw me in the sky like a pizza pie

You know I like ‘em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy
You know I like ‘em bad boy, like you

I like a man who can’t care/kick it
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
But I’m not gonna do it, baby

Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors (x3)

You know I like ‘em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy
You know I like ‘em bad boy, like you

Behind, behind closed doors

Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait but I can’t wait to see you
So I run like a child to heaven’s door
I don’t wanna be bad I won’t cheat you no more

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night
Darling, I’m waiting to greet you
Come to me baby

Spotlight, Bad Baby
You’ve got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you’re divine
Didn’t anyone ever tell you it’s ok to shine?

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night

Darling, I’m waiting to greet you
Come to me baby

Don’t be afraid of me, don’t be ashamed
Walking away from my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night
Darling, I’m waiting to greet you
Come to me baby

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I’ve been waiting to meet you

Grenadine, sunshine, can you break this heart of mine
Darling I’m waiting to greet you, come to me baby

You drive up in a summer sky, blue bentley
Death reflect detecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue bentley
Sun reflect detecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, We drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the colour of dawn
Like my lipstick, the colour of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue bentley

Death reflect detecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the 'Houses of the Holy'
Smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

But you were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby that’s a shame
You were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now
It's over

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit; nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

But you were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby that’s a shame
You were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
(You know what I'm talking about)

You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now
That it's over
Baby, how you feeling now
That I told you

It's true
All the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls
Love the way Bill plays guitar

You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Honey, how you feeling now
That it's over
Baby, how's life treating you now
That I told you

Honey, how is it feeling now?
(Honey, how's it feeling?, Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told you
(Honey, how's it feeling?, Honey, how's it feeling?)
I told you

Yes, I can make you that cherry pie

You can call me liberty
I'm your number one girl
You give me everything, I'm gonna save the world

Oh how I like the way you say my name
Do you like the way I say yours too?
Okay, you like the games I play
Roller coaster, Coca-cola
Crystal methamphetamine

I told you not to go into the woods,
I told you that he wasn't any good.
I told you not to go into the woods,
I told you that he wasn't any good.

I'll take the wrong path,
I think I'll go a little off track.
And now there's no way back,
You took all the apples that I had.
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl.
I heart you and I know you'll rock my world.

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got.
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up.
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shining bright in the dark.
Lifting up my little red skirt,
I know you'll leave me here in the dirt.
But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world!

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got.
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up.
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Life is like, like a little game,
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing's wrong, make me run, all night long.
Hide and seek is how you play with me,
Oh, you're tempting me, just for fun, just for fun.
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you'll leave.
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry red car.

(X2:)
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got.
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I saw you creeping around the garden
What are you hiding?
I beg your pardon don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion
To my surprise my loves demise was his own greed and lullaby

With your big eyes, and your big lies
With your big eyes, and your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer you had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching
As I looked on the flames grew high you watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

With your big eyes, and your big lies
With your big eyes, and your big lies

Is it me was I wrong to have trusted you
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women spanish, dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood with your song

Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue 
Oh, what can I do
Life is beautiful
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you 

Black beauty
Oh x2 

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
They seem like cherries in the spring
Darling you can't let everything seem so dark blue 

But oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue 
Oh, what can I do
Life is beautiful
But you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you 

Oh x5 
Black beauty baby x2 

Oh, what can I do
Life is beautiful
But you don't have clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you 

Black beauty
Oh x4

Blue jeans, White shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean, for sure
You so fresh to death & sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater, and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a milion years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like: "no please, stay here,"
We don't need no money we can make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin' but he was
Chasing paper
"Caught up in the game" that was the last I heard

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a milion years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time

He went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
Cause Ima ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit, at least you tried.
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more-but that not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancin all night
Then they took you away- stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...

I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a milion years
Promise you'll remember that your mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time

She wore Blue Velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of

She wore Blue Velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears

(Instrumental)

She wore Blue Velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears

She wore Blue Velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory through the years
And I still can see Blue Velvet through my tears

Elvis is my daddy, Marilyn’s my mother,
Jesus is my bestest friend.
We don’t need nobody, ‘cause we got each other,
Or at least I pretend.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin’ and grindin’ in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feeling alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
I’m on fire, sing the body electric.

Whitman is my daddy, Monaco’s my mother,
Diamonds are my bestest friend.
Heaven is my baby, suicide’s her father,
Opulence is the end.

We get down every Friday night,
Dancin’ and grindin’ in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, we're feeling alright,
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
I’m on fire, sing the body electric.

My clothes still smell like you,
And all the photographs say you're still young.
I pretend I’m not hurt,
And go about the world like I’m havin’ fun.

We get crazy every Friday night,
Drop it like it’s hot in the pale moonlight.
Grand Ole Opry, feelin' all right,
Mary’s swayin’ softly, to her heart's delight.

I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric,
I sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric,
Sing the body electric.
I’m on fire, sing the body electric.

I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.
I sing the body electric, baby.

Everytime you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

Everytime you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been witholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho, Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for
You are the one in my dreams that I'm waiting for

So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"

I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing


I need your love babe
I need your loving

I was born bad but then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You neva cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver ball

Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on the wrist, whiskey on my tongue
Before I'll be bad, I gotta get drunk
So get ova here, pour me a cold one

Baby can see that I'm danger
Turn to give in to the kindness of strangers

Précisément, but I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My Daddy's in the trunk, papa's brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

Get's a lil easier after telling puns
You know that I'm fine, you know that I'm young
So tell me your mind, let's get it on

Baby can see that I'm danger
Glamorous, but I'm deranged
Dancing on top of the tables
A sinner and a mess, how can you be my savior?

Précisément, but I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My Daddy's in the trunk, papa's brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

I love you, my darling
You, darling You, darling 
You, darling You, darling 
Dancing on top of the tables

Précisément, but I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My Daddy's in the trunk, papa's brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates
They'll tell me that your mine

Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design
I feel so alone on a friday night
Can you make it feel like home
If I tell you you're mine

It's like I told you honey

Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Lets go get high
The road is long we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Choose your last words
This is the last time
Because you and I
We were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Trying to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find

All the answers honey

Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Lets go get high
The road is long we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Choose your last words
This is the last time
Because you and I
We were born to die

We were born to die
We were born to die

Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Don't make me sad
Don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough
And the road gets tough I don't know why

Keep making me laugh
Lets go get high
The road is long we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

Choose your last words
This is the last time
Because you and I
We were born to die

We were born to die...

They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines
I say
I say

Well, my boyfriend's in the band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

They say I'm too young to love you
You say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see
But I'm free
I'm free

Well, my boyfriend's in the band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
So I don't have to fucking explain it

And my boyfriend’s in the band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection’s rare
I get down to beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Yeah my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Every Saturday night I get,
Dressed up to ride for you, baby.
Cruising down the street on,
Hollywood and Vine for you, baby.

I drive fast, wind in my hair,
I push you to the limits,
'Cause I just don't care.
You ask me where I've been,
I've been everywhere,
But I don't wanna be,
Anywhere but here.

Desire for you, baby.

To come alive for you, baby.
Santa Monica I'm racing in,
The lights for you, baby.

Have to touch myself,
To pretend you're there.

Your name is on my lips,
Over, over 'gain,
Like my only prayer.

Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden

We’re sippin' cocktails, looking down upon the riot
You whisper “Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you’re all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I’ve been through this before
They say “I’ll save you, save you”, but they never do

I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I’ll leave you
It’s sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run, run

I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I made the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
“I wanna take you, take you to the world outside.”
Well, I assume it’s what I wanted at the time
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign
“I wanna take you, take you,” and I didn’t mind

And even though I didn’t believe you
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always needs you
Try to reach you, try to please you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run, run

I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I made the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can’t let go, I’m sure that we should be forever

I look around, there’s no one above you
I think you know that I’ll always love you
And baby, I’m bad too, it’s not just you
But I can’t wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you’ve done makes me wanna run, run, run

I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I made the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I made the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies

You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him "go on, sing a sad song."

My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and cuts their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

You're hard to trap, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far-gone

My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!


These butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
I puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found


Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho...)

Goodbye to the paperback age
I’ll miss your touch
To flip you, crease you, lay underneath you, fall asleep to
Bye-bye darling I’ll miss you so much

Goodbye to the telephone age
I’ll miss your voice
To listen to, laugh to, talk in the bath to
Bye-bye darling we don’t have a choice

We had a run good run darling don’t you cry
I know in the end it’s gonna be just fine
Bye-bye darling

Goodbye to the accident age
I’ll miss the chance
To meet you on the street, sweep you off your feet, you know
Bye-bye darling, goodbye in advance

We had a run good run darling now don’t you cry
I know in the end it’s gonna be just fine
In the end it all feels like a dream
Someday we’ll find out what it means
Bye-bye darling

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

And every time I think of you I’m so glad
What we had they’ll never know
Every summer night we stayed up late
Blowing smoke into figure eights

Don’t say I’ll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it’s not true
I know you’re seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

I know they say I’m cheap
And you’re two-timing me
That’s what you get
We’re in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you’ll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

You’re all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic’s flawed and you’ve been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You’re all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you’re scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know that’s not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We’re living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You’re not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You’re not the only one
I’ve heard say, “Maybe”

You’re all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic’s flawed and you’ve been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You’re all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you’re scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

(One, two, three, oh)

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
Baby, you don't ever have to
Go faster than your fastest pace or faster than my fastest cars

I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
And honey, you don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
You're changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your folks and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long

Ooh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love
I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California
You should just hit me up

Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming honestly how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling them she's having fun

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous, and dumb at an early age
Lying, I'm lying

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, white lightning

Carmen, carmen, staying up till morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming truly how disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream, Coney Island queen

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walking at night, and a star by day
It's tiring, tiring

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, white lightning

Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Trying cherry knots similing, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi

The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, white lightning

Like lightning, white lightning...

Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself cause her liquor's top shelf

So I heard you wanna go to Rio baby
Yes, I've seen page six lately, ahh
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hacking in your phone and shit

Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She's got the best, sparklin' like a hollywood movie, ahhh

If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, cause I'm just like neon
Lighting up your night

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you my king

I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release and you're so cold
Are you crazy?

You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

Cause we were a match in heaven high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string x4

Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

My my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I'm making cherry pie
Show me what you got, got the sparkle in your eye
You're so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, look at daddy shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
While I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

My, my, talking all night
Laughing really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressing up nights
Drinks on ice

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you
I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street

Those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

Ah, but you got away, didn’t you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say

I need you, I don’t need you
I need you, I don’t need you
And all of that jiving around

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception

And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself and said, “Well, never mind
We are ugly but we have the music”

And then you got away, yeah, didn’t you babe
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say

I need you, I don’t need you
I need you, I don’t need you
And all of that jiving around

I don’t mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can’t keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well at the Chelsea Hotel
That’s all, I don’t even think of you that often

Love, I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
(Fuck!)

Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

Love, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah
(Fuck!)

Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces (bitch)
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)

My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces (bitch)
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
(Why?)

'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined (bitch)
Are ruined (bitch), are ruined (fuck!)

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave and you're very free

So swing it high, cherry blossom
On your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

Swing it high like Jesus, baby
Little ghost so fair like lemonade tea

Take me in your fast car mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you're driving
Doesn't care I'm always on my blackberry
All the time all the time buying into every line
I'mma flashy little lush but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard dressing like james dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying is the only solution
And I'mma tell any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We gonna get free free free free
Free free free get free

(Lana del rey)
Baby we are chancers on the scene
Grammar in the cutters only so arctic
See graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every dude you ever seen
We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah it must
But we do create the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're james dean
And the air girls blow kisses
Just like marilyn

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying is the only solution
And I'mma tell any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We gonna get free free free free
Free free free get free

(Lana del rey)
Run for your lives
They got 'em in chains
Let's hope that we merge
Create our own games
Dj's, rockstars, posers, we are
Then the politicians
That surrender the additions
And it's so pornographic and it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying is our only solution
And I'mma tell any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying is our only solution
And I'mma tell any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We gonna get free free free free
Free free free get free
We gonna get freed

Everything I want I have
Money, notoriety, rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flash bulbs of your pretty cameras,
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous, baby am I glamorous

Hello, hello!
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you wanna see me fall
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver line my heart
But burned into to my brain all these stolen images
Stolen images, baby stolen images
Can you picture this
What a life we could've lived

Hello hello!
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you wanna see me fall
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful they all say I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

We were two kids just tryin to get out
Live on the dark side of the american dream
We would stay out late, play our music loud
When we grew up nothing was what it seemed

Hello hello!
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you wanna see me fall
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

I was at Coachella, leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it, 'cause baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin', they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question

I was at Coachella, leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

What about all these children and all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question

A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like what's it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway

I hope you remember me like this
Dancing in the stars in my sundress
I was just a dreamer, no stress
And battles lines became paradise next to you

You been working hard 9 to 5 and
I'm doing my part in trying
Just to make you smile and get happy
Like daddy used to say to me
"When you're young and free
Stop and think of me"
Staying together is heaven when you look so good
And you taste so sweet

Never let me go
Boy hang on to me
Staying together forever it's heaven when you taste so sweet

When you're young and free

My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola

I won't cry myself to sleep, if I do, I'll die.
Now you fall asleep with another, damn you.

'Member how we used to escape for the summer?
Fireworks and sparkles would light up the black skies.
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other.

Hello, hello, where did you go?
We were two kids living life on the run, like the american dream, baby! 
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun.
We went too fast, too young.

But I won't cry myself to sleep, like a sucker.
I won't cry myself to sleep, if I do, I'll die.
Now you fall asleep with another, damn you, damn you.

Flowers in my hair and your breath smelled like whiskey.
Promised anywhere that I'd go, take you with me.
Dancing on your feet like a child to the radio.

Keepin' it fresh.
Gold chain, white mesh,

All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ahhh, that's how you sing it
Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ahhh, that's how we play it

And there's no remedy for memory,
Your face is like a melody,
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead

Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side

All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
Ahhh, that's why I stay here

And there's no remedy for memory,
Your face is like a melody,
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead

Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But that there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But that there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

It's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me

I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper, i l-l-love you

Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride

Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die

Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here
Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're mine

I don't know why you're, 
Looking at those other girls,

My, my, apple of my eye, 
Think you're really hot, 
And I want you to me mine.
I like the way the brain, 
On your pinky ring shine, 
Aye, aye, aye! 

Keep them other girls at bay, 
Oh, I would blow them all away.
Keep them other girls at bay, 
Oh, I would blow them all away.

You're no good for me
Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But baby I want you, I want you

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now low, down and gritty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses
Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I've been waiting up all night

Take another drag turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times

Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?

Disco
GoGo dancer so rare

Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know, no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends, but I’m the one that they want
Miss America, with the blue mascara on

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone

I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in, but I just have to go on
Miss America, now I’m gone, baby, gone

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

I'm a wild child, bright child, 
Knocking at your door.
You though that you are done, 
But now you want me even more.
Dum Dum.

I am star child, big smile, 
Living in LA, I'm coming over, 
Baby you can't go to school today, 
Dum dum, 
Go to school today.

I belong to bygone era, like Scarlett O'Hara, 
The downtown singers
I just wanna drink, I just wanna drink.

I am a pop little singer, 
Fam-bam zinger, 
Man's field ringer
From the Hollywood silver screen.

Into that something, 
Something so beautiful, 
You'll never be the same.
Born to die up fast, 

Of living my world, 
You'll be forever changed.

I am wild child, sky high, 
Lying on your floor, 
I know I had a lot, 
But baby wants a little more, 
Dum dum.

In my white mint pink cigarettes
From the store, we'll make margaritas, 
You wanna take a shot? Dum Dum.

I belong to a bygone era, 
Like the bugs in the long tipsy hair, 
Cuz I am on the scene, 
Yeah I am on the scene.

I am a bad jazz singer, 
Living in the finger, 
No matter what you linger, 
Cuz you like me even when I am mean, 
I am the Queen.

French vanilla ice cream, just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen, I can’t get a bite
Guess we could be more than friends, ‘cause this kiss won’t end
And you got me trembling

You’re dynamite, I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite, I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're one thing, rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

Speeding through the wasteland, sparkling in the lights
Roll up the boardwalk, derelict delight
Eyes are on my dress again
I know how this ends
Boy, you’re all adrenaline

You’re dynamite, I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite, I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're one thing, rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

He’s not like other guys, I can’t apologize
For what my body wants and what my heart decides
‘Cause I’m so close to the real thing
Yeah, I’m so close to the real thing
I’m so close to the real thing I could almost die

Say it isn’t over, say it’s not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere and start a pillow fight

You’re dynamite, I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite, I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're one thing, rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite

Platinum and felt acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's printing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar

Late, Motel lounge is singin'
Spotlight on the band that's swingin'
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

Elvis where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air

Tipping back, his head relaxing
Thank you very much and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace catchin'
Baby, on the chandelier

Sweeping scents and blue hydrangia
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far

You look like a Florida Native
Are you? I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the State of
Vermont with the Southern drawl

Elvis where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air

Tipping back, his head relaxing
Thank you very much and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catchin'
On the chandelier

He said he come to welcome warn me
Gesture diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well thank you

Elvis where are you when I need you most
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air

Tipping back, his head relaxing
Thank you very much an' I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catchin'
On that chandelier


Where are you when I need you most?

You can whistle for it

Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch tv
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses"

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body

I wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day my husband to be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree but the unlucky one

I'm going down, now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough but it wasn't
The earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire but we were wooden

I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day my mother to be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way it seems
One love begins, one comes undone

I'm going down, now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough but it wasn't
The earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire but we were wooden

All of my all of my fine china
All of my all of my fine china
All of my all of my fine china
Blue uh, blue

All of my all of my fine china
All of my all of my fine china
All of my all of my fine china
Blue uh, blue

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough but it wasn't
The earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire but we were wooden

Fine china, fine china, fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen, fresh linen
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Are you gonna hurt me now
Are you gonna hurt me later
Are you gonna go to town
Maybe you should play safer
You got me all dressed up tonight
Spring is staying on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Somebody you're telling me but I don't know

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You got me, watch
Baby I'm a flipside liquour
Catch you again
It comes and goes
Baby I'm a flipside liquour
Catch me again

Drinks in the patio

Are you gonna tell me now
Are you gonna tell me later
Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm coming after to say you're crazy
I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear your voice
I already know what you got in store
Why I go baby I don't know

Cause You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but

You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos on the keys, baby, oh ya
Gourds in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my s-

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

Zoom in my miles and gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winner when I'm in it... 

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos on the keys, baby, oh ya
Gourds in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my s-

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

We could get high in Miami or dance the night away
Even when I die in Miami, that's what they all say
(You believe me, don't you baby?)

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the Floridians say
Yayo, yayo, yayo
All the Columbians say
Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all my girlfriends
Yayo, yayo, yayo

That's how I do it
Come on, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Dance the night away

Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar but
What do you want from me, it's just a stupid bar and
I didn't promise anything, no

You think I'm pretty and you like way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're gonna get along

I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy?

Pretty baby
Pretty baby

The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now

Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no

Pretty baby
Pretty baby

All these feelings
I'm tired of them
Ruined all of my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I gave keep ordered as best I can

I can, you can
We can, who can
Keep it all together
Hit man, burn man
His man, her man
How about the weather?

All these people
I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the how and when
I try and answer the best that I can

But I can, you can
We can, who can
Keep it all together
Hit man, burn man
His man, her man
How about the weather?

All my worries, they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit a low

I can, you can
We can, who can
Keep it all together
Hit man, burn man
His man, her man
It will all get better

All the days, they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future's here at last
I don't need to have what she has

I can, you can
We can, who can
Keep it all together
Hit man, burn man
His man, her man
It will all get better

Sing it out
Sing it loud
Sing it loud
Sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out

I can, you can
We can, who can
Keep it all together
Hit man, burn man
His man, her man
We can make it better

We will have it better

30 blocks to Fordham Road, 
That's a bad neighborhood, 
Gray house on the corner, 
I know I shouldn't do what it is I could.
The stone Mary in the garden, 
She let me know she watching, 
She said I better get walking, 
I better walk away.
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay, 
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way, 
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say, 
I'm just gonna walk, 
I'm gonna walk away.
I catch a dollar in the wind and I buy a cup of coffee, 
There's a place on Valentine that still charge ninety cent.
I keep on walking in the daytime and in my eyes it's always night time, 
And I like it when it's me at night, 
'Cause that's when all the stars come out.
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay, 
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way, 
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say, 
I'm just gonna walk, 
I'm gonna walk away.
It's the greatest, 
It's the greatest day.
It's the greatest, 
It's the greatest day.
I'm not gonna do what I hear me say, 
I'm just gonna walk, 
I'm gonna walk away.

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Hmmm-hmmm-mmmm
Hmmm-hmmm-mmmm

I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up ‘til dawn
Maybe the way that I’m living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
“Maybe I’ll do it differently”

So I moved to California‚ but it’s just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go you take yourself‚ that’s not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It’s killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on‚ dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
I really do

I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit’s even brighter, you’re gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

You moved to California, but it’s just a state of mind
And you know everyone who does it
You can't feel it and you’re tired
Baby wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it’s killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on‚ dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard but you're not here, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly
(Fuck it, I love you)

California dream, I got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Chances in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)

Life is awesome, I confess,

You got nothing, I got tested, 
And I passed, yes.

Tell me songs at night, 
About your favourite girl.

Come on, get drunk
You know you wanna

I am lying, using again

Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For... and for... (shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (out of the black)
Into the blue (into the blue)

Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasin' rainbows
And hopin' for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (touch, touch)
There's nothin' to hold on to (hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (ah, ah, ah, yeah)

You got a face like the Madonna, crying tears of gold
Been pumping gas at the Texaco, road to road
You're on the run, oh, baby, yeah
You're on the run, oh, baby
I'm not a trick, but I'm a trick for you
You give me butterflies; heart's skipping one, two
I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm running temperatures thinking of your love, boo

Brooklyn, move my soul like this
Kissing my stilettos
Move your mouth up to my lips
Come on over, ghetto baby
(He said, "show me what you got, girl")
Come on over, ghetto baby
("Drop it like it's hot, girl")

I know your lips say that you wanna, but your heart's a no
But boy, your hips say that you're gonna when you hold me, hold me
You're so fun, b-baby, you are too much fun, b-baby
My local rock star, the Willy B. crew
I'm feeling you, boy, you likin' me too
I'm clockin' chicks left and right just to get to you
You're out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

Brooklyn, move my soul like this

We're a match made in Heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em
If they don't think we're good together, baby just forget 'em
When he's bad, he's bad
But when he's good, no one's better
Cause we're a match made in Heaven
And this kind of love's forever

Come back baby, come back to me
I'll be in my sundress watching TV
I've been missing you, have you been missing me?
Thinking 'bout your loving, 'bout your loving, sweet, sweet

Come back sugey, come back to me
Fix me up a mixed drink, Bacardi
I'll put on your favourite dress and we'll party
Take a drive, kiss, kiss by the sea
You don't have to say
That I'm the girl that got away

I been drinking Jack and Coke a lot
Sucking on my lollipops
Listening to my hard rock mu-mu-mu-music
Thinking 'bout you quite a lot
Smoking all my cigarettes

Dreaming 'bout your dolly, sweet dolly, dream, dream

You bad baby, dumb as can be
Who could you find be-be-better than me?
I've been missing you, you been missing me
Thinking 'bout your sugar sweet ca-candy

I drop it like it's hot, 
On the pole, on the pole.
Shining in the club, 
Neon gold, neon gold.

They call me firecracker, 
And alcohol's a factor.

I drop it like it's hot, 
Baby, bolt, baby, bolt.
A little bit of fun, 
For your soul, for your soul.

They call me firecracker, 
'Cause ain't nobody faster.

Take me as I am, take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide

Hmmm-mm
Hmmm-mm

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday, they destroyed me
But by Friday, I'm revived
Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

God knows I live
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
Let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life

God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried

Damn, look at the sunrise
Glowing finish line, made it in record time
Hey, baby, we made it
My head's faded, headlights dilated

Spinnin', spinnin' and I can't sit still
Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still

Baptized in blue skies
Roll the window down, reach out, feel around for new life
Damn, you and those green eyes
We can never stop movin', we see nothin' but the green lights

Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still
Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still

God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood

Climbed up the tree of life, kicked out of paradise
Living good, doing evil is the toss of the dice
Couple of wild eyes, cup full of high life
She's an angel and a devil of her own device

She's got me spinnin' (spinnin')
Spinnin' and I can't sit still (you know I can't sit still)
Oh, spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still

God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood

God save the ocean, God save the breeze
Save the words from my lips, save the birds, save the bees
Baby save me one last sip while you strip on the beach
I'll save you in the waves if you swim too deep
God save, God save our young blood
God save our young love

God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood

On the coast where we love
God save our young blood
On the coast where we love
God save our young blood

In the land of gods and monsters, I was an angel,
Living in the garden of evil,
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed,
Shining like a fiery beacon.
You got that medicine I need,
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly.
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly,
Me and God we don’t get along, so now I see...

No one’s gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Monitor, squeeze, squeeze, and I’m singing:
"Fuck yeah give it to me, this is&#65279; Heaven, what I truly want."
It's innocence lost.
Innocence lost.

In the land of gods and monsters, I was an angel,
Lookin' to get fucked hard.
Like a groupie, incognito, posing as a real singer,
Life imitates art.
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please.

I don't really wanna know what's good for me.
God's dead, I said, "Baby that's alright with me."

No one’s gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Motel, squeeze, squeeze, and I’m singing:
"Fuck yeah give it to me, this is&#65279; Heaven, what I truly want."
It's innocence lost.
Innocence lost.

When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy,
'Cause life imitates art.
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me, "Life isn't that hard."

No one’s gonna take my soul away,
I'm living like Jim Morrison.
Headed towards a fucked up holiday.
Monitor, squeeze, squeeze, and I’m singing:
"Fuck yeah give it to me, this is&#65279; Heaven, what I truly want."
It's innocence lost.
Innocence lost.

What happen to... Nobody does it better?

See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're pickin up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turn criminal?

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe?
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you found your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe?
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

There's someone child for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been tonight

There's no more chances for you now you never learn
You live on fire baby but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe?
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe?
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done

Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open you're eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand

Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again

Trouble's what feels good to me
Crazy as since I was three
Now I'm out to get you

But I'd have bet that lately, Ma
And I'm in love with everyone
And I don't want to think I'm wrong
Just for feeling pretty

Are you back in Greenwich dropping acid?
Are you at the archive, watching television?
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?
And your leather lookin' like Greg Kinnear?
Are you still the king of Rock 'n' Roll, babe?

Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that west side highway?
Do you miss your baby mama? Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?
Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?

How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the tire light
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?

(feat. A$AP Rocky)

You're in the bar, playin' guitar
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with the star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, livin' it up
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me

And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Time after time, writin' my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Takin' our dreams, turnin' them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?

And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Front row, every show like a hype man (hmm)
Sing along word for word while she my bae (yeah)
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade (hmm, hmm)
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate (hmm, hmm)
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain (yeah)
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love (hmm)
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a... (hmm)
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die (You and I 'til the day we die)

Heavy metal love of mine, I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time, but you were worth it anyway

Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man

He loved guns and roses,
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses,
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

Motorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway
We should have left Las Vegas and then began again
To kill? Back to the promised land

He loved guns and roses,
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses,
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

I can feel it coming in the island tonight
...
Turning tan in...
I can see you bathing in the sun light
You got game boy,
Game boy, game boy
You got game boy game boy,
Game boy
You got game

He loved guns and roses,
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses,
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

Roses
Roses
Roses
Roses
Roses
Roses

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

If you are in town, encore
Ah, ah

Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing, I
Lose myself in the music, baby
Everyday is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning, I
Sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he is a serial killer
Then what's the worst, that could happen to a girl
Who's already hurt
I'm already hurt
If he is as bad as they say
Then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes
I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, black rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
Ooh, oh-oh
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance
With you

Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it like every night
It escapes from my hands, into moonlight
Everyday is a lullaby
I hum it on the phone, like every night
And sing it for my babies on the tourlyfe
Ah

Hawaiian tropic, dark and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish

Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I’m shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lying?

And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late

You’re bigger than Elvis and cooler than B. I. G,
You’re smashing my dishes, you’re Billy The Kid,
You’re very American, sugar,
Marry me, dick, I love you.

We’re on the road to the Jersey Shore, one stop and then we’ll stop no more,
Pulling over at the 7/11 and you buy me pie because I’m sweeter than Heaven.

You say you love everything I am,
Love my lips and my golden tan.

You love my heartshaped sunglasses,
Love my heartshaped sunglasses,
Love my heartshaped sunglasses.

Spin me around, kiss me in your Chevrolet,
Top down, Heaven like crazy,
You let me drive, I’ll let you go all the way,
I’ll never ever, ever, ever let you get away, away

I was lounging in the Chateau Marmont
Glimmering by the swimming pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool."

I heard a man screaming, "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming
Open up that Lamborghini

Open up your butterfly doors
Heavy hitter
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's c-c-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You're the king mafia baby
I'm the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold
By mixing our souls to escape reality

Me and Monterrey went to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave, I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughing, I was running
Use that remote to open up

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's c-c-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You can be my higher power, baby
I can be your endless USA
We can go on drives for hours, baby
Let's cha-a-ange our DNA
Let's change our DNA
Let's change

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say?)
Open up your butterfly doors

Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream

Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothin's clear

Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

(It's fucking hot, hot) Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
(It's hot) Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, ah, oh my God
Jumpin' off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Baby (baby) come on (come on) come on (come on)

I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby

(It's hot, hot) Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here is harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore, it's so surreal
I can't survive if this is all that's real

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye bye

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive, we're sinking into the sand

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye bye

Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high baby, baby, bye bye

High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh

Anyone can start again
Not through love but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by vengeance, brings the end

One day my hopes will be made of diamonds
And my knuckles made of real gold
I’ll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old pot of Hollywood
Summer rise, I’m a super mother
By the electric and I dance like more ascend
When the night begins
Baby it comes alive again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I’m alive again
I’m alive again

One day I’ll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Beleron
Hair to my eyes, we’ll be flying in the widn
Shootin’ narrow in these peoples
See the sea, I’m a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Chamberlain
When the sun descends
I dive into the waves again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I’m alive again
I’m alive again

Oh oh
Girl can you say that?
Oh oh
My heart bleeding fast, I can feel it chasing in the speed lights
That well makes me to last
Oh oh
Girl can you feel that?
Oh oh
My heart, it’s shakin fast, I can feel that you’re gonna run for me
You’ve been my first and you’ve been my last

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I’m alive again
I’m alive again
I’m alive again
I’m alive again

Our kind of love, 
It was once in a lifetime.
It couldn't last, 
It was doomed from the first time.

And you were 50's cool, 
In blue suede shoes, 
But it was a cover for, 
All of the trouble, 
You got into.

I always fall for the wrong guy, 
Things that are bad always taste nice, 
That's what girls like me do, lose you.

Don't tell me it's over! 
Don't tell me it's over! 

Hollywood's dead, 
Elvis is crying, 
Vicious in flames, 
Roland is dying.

And in the light, you're, 
Sickeningly beautiful.
Say goodbye, you're, 
Sickeningly beautiful.

This kind of life, 
Wasn't meant for the good girl.
Try as I might, 
In the end it's a cruel world.

And you are living proof, 
Sinatra aloof, 
That you were an actor, 
Who only went after, 
The ones who swooned.

I always fall for the same type, 
Gangsters in Vegas on game night, 
That's what girls like me like, 
The limelight.

Don't tell me it's over! 
Don't tell me it's over! 

Hollywood's dead, 
Elvis is crying, 
Marilyn's sad, 
Hendrix is lying there.

In the light, you're, 
Sickeningly beautiful.
Say goodbye, you're, 
Sickeningly beautiful.

If you should go, 
Before me then know, 
That I always loved you, 
There's no one above you, baby.

Don't tell me it's over! 
Don't tell me it's over! 

Hollywood's dead, 
Elvis is crying, 
Lennon wake up, 
Cobain stop lying there.

In the light, you're, 
Sickeningly beautiful.
Say goodbye, you're, 
Sickeningly beautiful.

Say goodnight, you're, 
So beautiful! 

Hollywood's dead, 
Hollywood's dead, 
Hollywood's dead, yeah.
Hollywood's dead, 
Hollywood's dead, 
Hollywood's dead, yeah.

(Cut)!

We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go 'cause truly there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues - Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
Or whatever you want to do, we make the rules

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
We could cruise to the news - Pico Poulevard in your used little bullet car if we choose
Mr. "Born to Lose"

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue

There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs
And a fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town
Had neither fought nor found you
Everything you do is elusive
To even your honey dew

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that I'm not

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on the walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

I had fifteen-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah I've got
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say "Hi, Dad"

I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have

You are broiling hot
Santa Monica Boulevard
Black tint glass on your cherry red car
You know very well no one's bad as you are

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got

John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his should 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Jim met me down at the training yard
The cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and turns them to ground again
And I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

And this is how they disappear
This is how they disappear

Well now, it's been years since I left New York
And I got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
And I watched the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
And I whisper in your ear

I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere

Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dying for him to come over
I’m in my party dress, he say, "You such a mess."
I am the New Jersey Dance Queen, he is the construction king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best cause he knows what’s up
He knows it’s a big bad world, knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
(Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill)

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill

(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk)

J. is a romantic roller coaster
He don’t do anything he supposed to
I like 'em tough and mean, Jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am the trailer park darling, he is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be looking to die
He says, baby, pay respect to the high
He knows it’s a big bad world, knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
Cause cash comes quick when looks can (kill)


I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue
I like your ultraviolent swing
I like it when you treat me mean
You turn my mood from black to blue
(Twenty of 'em wrapped up tight in-)

I Can Fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly
I Can Fly

I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
I was painting in the garden like a ghost in Mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine


I Can Fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly
I Can Fly

Your lies were hard kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a Phoenix
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I Can Fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly
I Can Fly

Your words cut like a knife and butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

I Can Fly
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly
I Can Fly

He don't like no small things
Even riding round on tall dreams
I don't want to go
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather and his blue jeans

He got a way, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't want to go, go home
I don't want to go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

He don't like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

He got a way, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't want to go, go home
I don't want to go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

Loving you isn't right
Black leather moonlight (I give in)
Loving you isn't right
It's original sin

I don't want to go, go home
I don't want to go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the reason we exist
Eveybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon

He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthem

Wait, wait, for me
Wait, wait, wait, for me
Come on, baby

I was in a bad way, honey
Til I met you
I was in a bad place, honey
I need you

I was going nowhere fast, you were bringing me down
I wanted to go, you were the cutest guy in town

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don’t wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way

Bring me that bud/Bring it on up/punk, you know that I want you/it
I’m not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
It’s on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don’t leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your babydoll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie?
Why do all the best girls like bad guys? Cos they’re to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don’t wanna go
Take me with you
I don’t wanna go away, no
Take me with you

I need you, I want you, you know that

What an unusual name you said
What a spectacular letter
You really seem like a prize, to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are notorious
Oh what do you mean to me he said
How do you know me so well?
After only one night I, I, I, I had
How do I love you, tell me
Though in my mind
I'm indebited to you, I'm indebited to you
Always

There's something he doesn't know about me
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive sign on his arm
Oh my, ai, ai
She got the skeletons dance when
Some secrets he know she never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said, how did I know you so well
Why am I not surprised?
He said, baby go to hell and
That will set demise of your love
Don't ever pick up the man,
If you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you
Have a history of being a loving fool

So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know him so well
Not more than one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might
I'm indebited to you, in indebited to you
My lovea

I'm smokin' while I'm runnin' on my treadmill
But I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm comin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time
While you're takin' what's mine with the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again
(I'm makin' no sense at all)
Drown out all our screamin'
(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke they can hear me comin'
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
Well, you know what you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feelin' so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again
(I'm makin' no sense at all)
Drown out all our screamin'
(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

Got me up in this place right now
Makin' no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feelin' so blue
Makin' no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feelin' so much right now)
Talkin' in my sleep again
(I'm makin' no sense at all)
Drown out all our screamin'
(Got me feelin' so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feelin' all my fuckin' feelings

Everybody said it wasn’t love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long

You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I’d never leave you

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

Everybody said: “Careful of that guy.”
Baby couldn’t stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feigning love by holding tight
But I need you, don’t want to, but need to

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

You’ve been messing around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can’t trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

I guess it’s symptomatic of this slight infatuation
Stalking you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I’m having visions

I fell for you, you like me too
Lets get it on check 1, 2
I fell for you, you want me too
Let’s get it on

Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
Making out with you
While you’re singing your song
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
You’re playing your guitar and it’s turning me on
You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car, like a star
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong I don’t wanna be right

I get so systematic in this kinda situation
I need it, have to have it to take over domination
Used to be so simple, never wanting never wishing
Now I’m hooked on fame and I’m a girl on a mission

I fell for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on check 1, 2
I fall for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on

Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
Making out with you
While you’re singing your song
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
You’re playing your guitar and it’s turning me on
You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car, like a star
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong I don’t wanna be right

The funny little thing about love
Is that you’re blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You’re wanting more it isn’t right
But you can’t stop

You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car
You got your eye liner, long hair
Walking round like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong I don’t wanna be right

I've been to Hollywood hills taking violet
Pills writing all of my songs about with cheap friends
You're a hard man to loving on
A hard woman to keep track of
You like to rage don't do that
You want your way You make me so mad
Got your gun I've gon' my day

His smile like a million roses bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby

He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat like a base for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable song
That's my baby
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold
You've got a way like jfk
When you pull it the way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so erratic the way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall
A heart like a base that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond, an inimitable song
That's my baby
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold
You've got a way like jfk
When you pull it the way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so neurotic the way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
You've got it and I want it
Wild summer nights in July, funny
You know that you can always come home to the one who gave you your name
'Cause I see a light in your eyes
It's so bright and the skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby
You've got a way like jfk
When you pull it the way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so erratic the way you see through play that shit
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Just like the way, just like I'm dreaming
How do I do it?

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Baby
Never mind

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
My heart starts to race
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

So pretty

You play the bass
Don't say no, just let me go
Baby
I don't know
Lie me down
When you play the bass
I get this feeling
Heart starts to race

Palm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Right line, right man
Right mixture of cocaine an heroin

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Cadillac convertible with him
Hot shot at two A. M.
You got that grin of a very hollow man

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Palm trees in black and white
You hot junkie on your window smiling wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes
Last fight, fuck them
Last words before you went and left again

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you, do you wanna?

Just do what you love, just do what you can
Just do what you love, just do what you can
Just do what you love, do it better than
Just do what you love, do it better than

Do you wanna?
Do you wanna?
Jump

Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going to leave you?

I'm in love with a dying man.
I'm in love with a dying man.
All our love is flying in the sand.
I'm in love with a dying man.
I'm in love with a dying man.
I've done every thing I can.

Tell me about Brian and his girl
Do I know Brian is going to meet you?
Love you, I do.
Stay here, I won't.
As stars fade from your eyes.

I was born bad
But then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true.

You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer at a silver ball
I did what I had to do... 

Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist, whiskey on my tongue
Before I give back, I gotta get drunk
So get over here, pour me a cold one.

Babe you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say hey-yeah

Time to give in to the kindness of strangers.

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck.

Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me your mind, let's get it on.

Babe you can see that I'm danger
Glamorous, but I'm deranged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely so can you be my savior?

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck.

I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl?

Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.

Baby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found

I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamond rings
My feet don't even touch the ground

Chariots of gold
I ride with Jay-Z, Jared Leto
I'm a super power, now they call me the tornado
I've got roses in my hair, I belly dance and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely, everybody told me no

No one lives forever, 
But that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So, baby, let's get it on

Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on Earth.

I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Sometimes the life is great on Earth

Chariots of gold, 
I sit, sipping cherry cola
Caesar say he'd fall in love with me if I was older.
I hold all the Mexico and I got my own roller coaster
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can't hold me now

No one lives forever
But that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So, baby, let's get it on

I stay up late at night, tryin' not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy, willing all the word without love
I get so tired being on this place somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions are lonely now

No one lives forever
But that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So, baby, let's get it on

No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

You make me wanna let my hair down, man
You make me wanna let my hair down
You make me wanna let my hair down, man
You make me wanna let my hair down

You get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can
You get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can

You got me dancing up the stairs now, man
You got me dancing up the stairs now
You got me dancing up the stairs now, man
You got me dancing up the stairs now

Get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can

You make me wanna let my hair down, man
Make me wanna let my hair down
Make me wanna let my hair down, man
Make me wanna let my hair down

You got me burning in my soul now, man
You got me burning in my soul now
Got me burning in my soul now, man
You got me burning in my soul now, man

You get me moving like no one can
You get me moving like no one can
You get me moving like no one can
Get me moving like no one can

Don't be that way
Don't you pretend
You're not away
Your soul's on fire
I don't believe
This is the end

Come on boy, let's go
We can hit the road
We don't have to stay
Where we're going
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
Right now
Life is still so beautiful

You should have let me know that I have no chance at all
I can never be what you wanted
Should let me know... still think about us
You told me you was on it! 
Sometimes I wonder why, why I even bother
Try to pull you out, boy! 
Should have let me know I would lose you to the drink

Chorus:
Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
I can hold you, hold you! 

You should have let me know, 
But you worked around the clock
They try to live harder, yeah! 
You should have let me know, 
But you're afraid to love me
You're looking like a liar! 
Sometimes I wonder why, why I even ask you
But I do! 

Chorus:
Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you!

Baby, you’re my Bugsy Malone and I’m your suicide blonde,
You can be my film noir star I’m your queen of Saigon
If they don’t think we’re good together, baby, just forget ‘em
And let bygones be bygones

Baby, I can’t do it alone, ‘cause you’re the one that I want,
You can be my Tony Montana and I can be your Pfeifer,
Fire, I can take you higher, I could get you hooked on love and desire.

Hello, pretty baby, you can be my cherry pie,

It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die.

Got the lipstick on, enduring to say my name again, say my name again, say my name again.

Baby, I can’t do it alone, ‘cause you’re the one that I want,
You can be my Tony Mantola and I can be Mariah,
Tiger, scream a little higher, I can get you high on love and desire.

I sense Bonnie and Clyde was two kids
So good at being bad, bad, bad.
I’m flirting with the check-out counter, baby,
Put the money in the bag.

Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die.

Put your hands where I can see them,
Put them in the air.

So tonight, are you gonna be my soldier?
Are we gonna be Bonnie and Clyde?
It's either live or die boy, it's either live or die.
Are you gonna be my lover?

One, one
Would you be mine, would you be my baby tonight
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got don't you know
It's you that I adore, though I make the boys fall like dominoes

Kiss me in the D. A. Are. K. Dark tonight

Never was in love, skipping heart beats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feelin the heat beatin when the sun goes down

Topple you down from your sky forty stories high
Shining like a god, can't believe I got you inside
Look at what I bought, not a second thought, oh romeo

Just you and me feelin the heat beatin when the sun goes down

I want my cake and I want to eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair and my suntan, short dress, bare
Feet
I don't care what they say about me, what they say about me
Because I know that it's L. O. V. E.
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone...

Let them all say

Just you and me feelin the heat beatin when the sun goes down

Took a trip to San Francisco
All  our friends said we would jive
Didn't  work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
Used  to only worry about them after dark

I’m  still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It’s just a dream I had in mind

Took  a flight to New York City
I miss that Hudson River line
Took the train back to Lake Placid
That's another space and time
Where we used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do, yeah

I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

It's just a dream I had in mind

Look at you kids with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter cause it's enough
To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)

Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

Though It's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)

Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

And It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love (ah, ah)
I'm young and in love (ah, ah)

Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (ah, ah)

Don't worry, baby

In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin’ through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest, in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, that's a test
And yes, now I'm here with you and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You move, but I just got to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of a love song

Dream a dream, here’s a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don’t waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest, in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, that's a test
And yes, now I’m here with you and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You move, but I just got to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of a love song

The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of a love song

Let's get out of this town, baby we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher, and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found

I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along scooped me up like a baby

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones

Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Boy get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out, now, now, now
Yeah your a careless con, and you're a crazy liar
But baby, nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones

Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Feels like, feels like, you know, it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know, it feels like
Falling in love

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones

Everybody told me your voice blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

(feat. The Weeknd)

Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign, yeah
In these stolen moments
The world is mine (doo wop, doo wop)
There's nobody here, just us together (shadoop, shadoop)
Keepin' it hot like July forever

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come today
'Cause boy, we're gold; boy, we're gold
And I was like...

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young

'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life

Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive

Then, we dance on the H of the Hollywood sign, yeah
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die (doo wop, doo wop)
My boyfriend's back
And he's cooler than ever (shadoop, shadoop)
There's no more night, blue skies forever

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like...

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young

There's no stopping now, green lights forever
And I was like...

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

Keeps us alive, keeps us alive

Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I came to see.
There's someone I have never talked about
I know that we both be dead if you found out.

Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can remember how to play along
There's something that I never told
I'm not really from this world
There's something I've been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

La la mahi mahi la la
La la mahi mahi la la
You are the man of my dreams I'm looking for
You are the man of my dreams I'm looking for

So if you begin
To think that my light might be supernatural
I'll have to say you're right
You right, mon cher, it is!
I come from a place
That your mind cannot even imagine.
Where we sing
Maha maha maha maha maha, maha,

La la mahi mahi la la
La la mahi mahi la la
You are the man of my dreams I'm looking for
You are the man of my dreams I'm looking for

Well we say maha maha maha
Oh maha, maha

I give my life for
I’m your devoted
I give my love, babe
I’m your devoted
Maha maha, maha maha
Maha maha, maha maha

Hi ya honey, what you doing?
I’ve been hula-hooping
Waiting for you, oh ah

Woah, haters, fakers, mass manipulators
Don’t know what you’re trying to prove

I’m the New York City queen, queen
You should hear me sing, sing
Baby, I’m the real thing check, 1, 2
Stop looking at my trainwreck life
And start listening to the way I sing the blues

You know, I know what they say about me
I know they think I’m danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy

It doesn’t really matter what you say
Cause I ain’t gonna quit till the day I die
I’ll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot
Baby, you can’t stop me, stop me no
When I’m hot, I’m hot

Hi ya honey, how’s it going?
Saw you skipping rope on tv
Looking blue, oh ah

You’re shaking, making music and you’re famous
Deep down you’re the same girl I knew

She said: “I know what they say about you
I know that they think you’re crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby”

It doesn’t really matter what you say
Cause I ain’t gonna quit till the day I die
I’ll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot
Baby, you can’t stop me, stop me no
When I’m hot, I’m hot

Singing for the gangsters
Chasing all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there’s nothing for my anchor
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It’s like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge
Never knowing where I’m going to be
And I’m dreading ever
Settling down that’s when
Dying is beginning to gleam

It doesn’t really matter what you say
Cause I ain’t gonna change till the day I die
I’ll be taking drugs, doing shots
Making out in parking lots with any little boy I spot
Honey, you can’t stop me, stop me no
When I’m hot, I’m hot

Ah ah ah ah
Oh oh oh oh…

Are you feeling lucky tonight?
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn
Are you wearing nothing tonight, Marilyn?
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn
Are you blessing somebody tonight?
Are you blessing?

Have you ever seen Downtown New Orleans, that's where I'm from
That's were I've been, where I was made
Somewhere laying in between
Marilyn, Marilyn
Marilyn, Marilyn

You took my sadness out of context
At the mariners apartment complex
I ain't no candle in the wind

I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins

So, kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?

Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

And who I am is a big time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand

'Cause even in the dark I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (yeah)

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man


Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

He dyed his hair black

We all wear black
We are trying to be fine
Elvis and Marilyn
Marilyn
Marilyn
Marilyn
Marilyn

Me and my boyfriend
We are lying a lot
We don’t leave often
We live our life as a song

Understand this, I'm not looking
For true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight

I've been working everyday eight to nine and
Servin' coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me you know where to find me

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby

Understand this, I've been liking
You since I was small
I don't wanna get you running scared
When there's no pressure there at all

I've been working eight to nine everyday and
Think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I want to see you I drive by

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby

I'm the sweetest girl in town so
Why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid bitch
You got it's me you should be seeing

Hello you are looking so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a goldmine, goldmine
Asking everybody is he mine, is he mine
Not quite yet but I'm gonna get, get him
Not quite yet but I'm gonna get, get him

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss kiss on my lips now baby

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
I, a white sweater, for the last white day
Of the summer

By my purple wig
For my mermaid video
Walk back to where we live
In a motel
Never knew

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Heavy metal hour on T.V.
Diamond Dave and Ray late
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Methamphetamines, pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For then, a dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island?

When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins, blue 50's song
The veranda look so shimmer
Neon palm sway

What's happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grow
And so I bid you farewell

They call me firecracker cause I sparkle, sparkle
Ah, they call me sunshine in the dark I glow like neon gold, neon gold
On the dance floor, dance floor
I'm your midnight answer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
I put my eyes on you, eyes on you
In it to win
So I drop it like it's hot on the pole, sin sin

They call me firecracker 'cause I'm danger, danger
They say that I'm like crack because my taste will change ya
I'm neon gold, I'm neon gold
Go-go dancer, dancer
Light me up that cancer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
Put my eyes on you, eyes on you
I'm in it to win
So I drop it like it's hot on the pole, spin spin

You know I love you, right?
What else you looking for?
I am the go-go girl next door, door
I won't take no, no
For an answer
I'm in to win it
Let me be your private dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer

Break up with your girlfriend, let me move in
I see the way you look at me and I loved you since
Put my eyes on you, eyes on you
In it to win
So I drop it like it's hot in the night club pole
Spin, spin
Spin, spin
Spin, spin
Spin, spin

You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me close in our final hour

I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do, but you're unbelievable
I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted as long as you

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, and so I'm finally ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,
You look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?

You got that world baby I reprise
Something so strange, and it's hard to define

It isn't that hard boy, to like you or even love you
I will follow you down down down,
Why? Cause you're unbelievable
So if you're going crazy just grab me and take me
I would follow you down down down, like anywhere anywhere

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, and so I'm finally ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,
You look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?

I don't know,
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,
You look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?

Have you ever seen a dead man?
A dead man lying in the road
Have you ever heard his best friend?
His best friend say you'd better go
Before you get fined
Or else you'll do time

Oh it's all about money, money
Money hunny
It's all about money, money
Well alright

Have you ever seen an old man?
An old man living all alone
Have you ever heard an old man?
An old man hear the way he moans?
Because he's so tired
Because he just got fired

Oh it's all about money, money
Money hunny

It's all about money, money
Well alright

Lately I've been
Feelin' like the world is weighing
Down on me again
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ooh

Have you ever seen a broke man
Seen a broke man begging for his life?
Have you ever heard a broke man
Heard a broke man, heard the pain & strife?
In his one line plea, in his dull edged knife

He asking for money money yeah money hunny
He asking for money money well alright
Well alright
Well alright
Well alright

You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?

You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
No what I want at all

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

The sun also rises on those who fail to call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory

Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
What's your address?

I'm your National Anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons

He loves to romance them
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to "be cool" but
I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes"

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down
Making me so wow, wow
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body down town
Red, white, blue's in the skies
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the reason
We exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the National Anthem
While I'm standing over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me
Or your pants on
See what you've done to me
Give me Chevron

You said to "be cool" but
I'm already coolest
You said to "get real"
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, also a gun)

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down
Making me so wow, wow
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body down town
Red, white, blue's in the skies
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the six page
Want a quick sick rampage?
Wining and dining
Drinking and driving
Excessive buying
Overdosin', dyin'
On our drugs and our love
And our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Love again, lonely
I need somebody to hold me
We will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep my safe in his bell tower, hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress

I'm your National Anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you is landin'
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and Angel
Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Ooh, yeah, baby, bow down
Making me so wow, wow
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body down town
Red, white, blue's in the skies
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Hold me in your arms,
Love me like your best friends did,
Promise, I won't hurt you kid,
Hold me really tight until the stars look big,
Never let me go.

All the world is ours,
Like they say in Scarface kid,
You can push your drugs and I can make it big,
Singing cb Jeebies have a real good gig,
Hey you never know.

Cause baby we were born to live fast and die young,
Born to be bad, have fun,
Honey, you and me can be one,
Just believe, come on.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.

We gonna go far,
I can already taste it kid,
La's gonna look real good,
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big,
Never let me go.

Send me to the stars,
Tell me when I get there kid,
I can be your Nancy,
You can be my Sid,
Get into some trouble like our parents did,
Hey, they'll never know,

Cause baby we were born to be bad,
Move on,
Built to go fast,
Stay strong,
Honey, you and me and no one,
Just believe,
Come on.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.

I remember when I saw you for the first time,
You were laughing,
Sparking like a new dime,
I came over,
"Hello, can you be mine?"
Can you be mine,
Can you be mine?

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Baby it's a sweet life,
Sing it like a song,
It's a short trip,
Only getting one who can count on my love more than anyone,
Never let me go.

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away,
It's a game boy,
I don't wanna play,
I just wanna be yours,
Like I always say,
Never let me go.

Boy, we're in a world war,
Let's go all the way,
Put your foot to the floor,
Really walk away,
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday,
Never let me go, just stay.

Another day is over,
Another day is done
And now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun

Chorus:
Hey babe, what you doin'?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin'?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over,
Another day is done,
Another night I'm waiting,
Waiting for the sun

Chorus:
Hey babe, what you doin'?
Would you like a little company?
Hey man, how you doin'?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Well, I don't know, little lady,
You're awfully pretty, but I'm a nice man,
I live a nice life, I have a nice house,
I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making decisions
Without thinking, oh oh oh

Another moon is shining,
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
'Till the night is done

Chorus:
Hey man, what you doin'?
Would you like a little company?
Hey there, how you doin'?
Would you like to sit next to me?
Next to me
Next to me

Walking is an art, so is my body
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party

I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips above the 'cardi
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness
He says '"who's the best?" You is! 

I'm glamorous famous
Notorious dangerous but you're crazy

I'm gonna leave you
He said ''you're not a real girl
You're like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck 
May all the stars in the sky
Bow down to you, we're through"

You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty
Papi is a gangsta, I'm his little dolly

Party favor favorite of them all 
He says "baby Dolly's so sick"
Sick off your naughtiness

Let's go to Vegas
He say "who's the best?"
He said ''she is, she is but, yo
She crazy like in every single way
Like a hurricane
You gotta get out of the way
But she's hot, and she's cold
And she's cool and she's bold
And she's full of rage like me
And I like the game, yo"

Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo
Glamorous dangerous
Notorious but famous but I'm crazy

He's gonna hate me
He wants a real girl
I'm like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
He said ''we're through"

Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon, know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see you through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

'Cause you’re just a man
It’s just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue

Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have an la crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool
Glimmering darling
Wipe bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples you
Sit and sipping on your black crystal oh yeah

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins
Give me them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases
Of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted, facing
Time again on Riker's island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlett, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth

My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me, admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make up
Glass full, perfume, cognac, lilac fume
Says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you want me, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races, cases
Of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows I'm wasted, facing
Time on Riker's island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlett, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth

Now I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is,
Tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is, shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down

God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlot
Queen of coney island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry about it

My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him til the end
But I trust in the decision of the lord, to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way
I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you
They will rue the day I was alone without you

You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said hon' you never looked so beautiful
As you do now my man

And I'm off to the races, places
Ready set the game is
Down and I'm going in
To las vegas, playoffs
Casino oasis
Honey it is time to spin
Boy you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever
Not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

Oh, say can you see my stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through Hayley's and look at the bars
Night time is almost ours

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face then they've made the dark
The voice of Nirvana says, "Come as you are"
And I will
The night time is almost ours

A sway of the hips and arms
We'll cradle you from afar
They swing till you tire and send it alarms
Night time is almost ours

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and white sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you use to call
The queen of New York City

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

And if you call I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, sunset and vine
And we were young and pretty

You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue.
I, I think that you, 
I think you're so cool babe
Loving everything you do.

You say we're gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway.

Spin me round kiss me in your chevrolet.
I love you more with each and everyday.
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down.
Spin me round kiss me in your chevrolet.
You found me when I had lost my way.
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown.

You, know what I want.
Take me to the k-mart, pick me up pink lipgloss.
How, you get so hot
You're making me crazy
Hoping you'll never stop.

You say that we were meant to be.
We'll be together finally.
Flying around and I'm finally free ouu.

Spin me round kiss me in your chevrolet.
I love you more with each and everyday.
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down.
Spin me round kiss me in your chevrolet.
You found me when I had lost my way.
Foot down we're going all the way touchdown.

We're on our way (X4)

Why, did I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss.
You, you got a real good plan
My trouble's all over now
Because you're my man.

You don't know what you've done to me.
You're heavier than heavenly.
Life on the run has set me free, me free now.

We're on our way (X15)

You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss.

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
Yet I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

But if I know you, I know what you do
You love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

But if I know you, I know what you do
You love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

Little bits and pieces, falling through the corners
Box of broken lices, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you your future, you tell me your story
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Smiles from the stranger, seem to change the day when
You were just about to, go ant throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking bout making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

... like the sunshine, set on... 
Happy like a twister over akaluma
Clear as penny mason lying in a coma
This is our feeling, all my hurt is over
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow... 
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're gonna go home again
Ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
Ta ta ta ta da da ra ra

I'm his little downtown baby doll
I'm his little downtown baby doll
He likes to come and hear me sing rock and roll
And watch me when I'm workin' on the silver pole

Trouble on the train at the festival
Come and get your girl, yo, he gets the call
Come and picks me up at the Bowery Ball

I'm his little downtown baby doll
Everybody tells him I'm trouble, y'all
Doesn't really care 'cause he likes to fall

Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright letting nice things go

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold and made of flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them all
I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no no
But I gotta get to and from where I come
And it's gonna take money to go
Oh no, oh oh, oh oh...

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows
Oh no, oh no, oh no...

I can do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Well, I didn't know it would come to this
But that's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright letting nice things go

You have a right
To live your life
Like no one else does
Like no one else might

If you have visions
Come on and live them out

All you need
Is some peace while you are here
Just let go
Until you are home, dear

I had a dream
When I was young
I dreamt out lives were
Going to be fine

We were always
Waiting to live

All you need
Is some peace while you are here
Just let go
Of it all, dear

You have a choice
To hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound
Of your sweet voice

I know I've heard it
I heard it in my sleep

All you need
Is some peace while you are here
Just let go
Don't say no, dear

Wake up each night
At the same time
Pull up the blinds
And look outside

And in the orange light
The fog is rising

This is life
This tonight
Peace in the quiet
Happiness
Is the sky

Baby I have become, 
Baby I have become someone
A monster, eh-eh-yeah
A monster, eh-eh-yeah

Vrizes, Wrizes a diamond tiara
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara
I have a disco ball mind
Lights flashing all of the time
I have ideas go by my mind
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna die, I wanna die
Uh yeah

Baby I have become someone
Baby I become who i-i-i-i, 
Baby I have become someone
Not of this world, eh-eh-yeah
Not of this world, uh-uh-yeah

That's for sure.

The house was already on fire,

Well, I'm a little shaken, 
But I'm fine, thanks for asking.

Work alone so late?

Cop car, officer.
You can ask me anything you want, 
Anything, anything.

Do you have a girl? I don't see, 
A ring on your finger.
Well that's interesting, have you, 
Ever thought of dating a singer?

The flames are getting higher, 
So's my desire.
It's kind of exciting, 
Don't you think?

Then suddenly, he's uncuffing me.

I'm in love, I'm in love, 
Love in a hurricane.
I'm in love, I'm in love, 
Love in a hurricane.

I've been bad, I've been wrong, 
Playing a dangerous game.
I'm in love, I'm in love, 
Love in a hurricane.

Hurricane, hurricane.

If you can't stand the heat, 
Then stay out of the fire, 
You might get what you, desire.
Boy, love is strange, 
Sometimes it makes you crazy, 
It can burn or break you.

If you can't stand the heat, 
Then stay out of the fire, 
You might get what you, desire.
Boy, love is strange, 
Sometimes it makes you crazy, 
It can burn or break you down.

I'm in love, I'm in love, 
Love in hurricane.
I'm in love, I'm in love, 
Love in a hurricane.

I've been bad, I've been wrong, 
Playing a dangerous game.

Pretty baby if you don't like the way
That I touch you
Then I won't touch you no more yeah
Pretty baby if you don't like the way
That I love you
Then throw my love on the floor
My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don't you want me
I don't believe you, when you say you
Want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don't think
That you gonna want me
Then honey let me know
Listen honey, I don't wanna keep thinking
You love me
Just to find out you don't

My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don't you want me
I don't believe you, when you say you
Want to leave
Won't you gonna miss me?
Honey I'll miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight

Pretty baby if you don't like the way
That I hold you
Then honey let me go
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way
That I told you
Then baby tell me so
My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don't you want me
I don't believe you, when you say you
Want to leave

All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I the girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that
I'm your girl
You make me...

I'm the girl that has always been the wild one
But when it comes to you I'm the affectionate one
You changed don't know how people didn't see
You were the one for me
Now I'm here sittin cryin
But your the only one whos pretty cryin
And I'm the one who ended this
Even though you know I wish
That you were my husband and I was the pretty one crying

You have this way of making me say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you, but I could not feel less connected from you! 
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried
I know I could... not so happy time of your life.
My dreams are bigger than all your junky pride
I don't quit fit the part of... everything and falls into insanity.
The sun beams, mean nothing if you can't find the light shining in one thing
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried
I know I got you, and I'm not so happy... time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride.
It's fine if you're hateful, as long as you remain grateful
It made me nervous... like me I really tried
The way I'm feeling in this moment it can't last my whole life! 
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride! aa

Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "Be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star I've ever seen
And I never dreamed I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king too so I would say, "back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my makeup on
And make up stories 'bout my life and that I'm very cherry bomb
And even then I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in hall like "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like "let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say "shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls and then my first Nirvana song
So even then when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in hall like "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like "let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say that all I want is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
From the 1950's wearing those big pearls
I'll cook you breakfast
Coffee on your desk, yes
I might burn your toast
But baby, I'm still the bestest

It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
On the colored tv, it was a new world
The dick Van Dyke Show
We're Cher and Bono
The way I sing 'i Got You Babe'
Makes you say "oh no"
Cause you're the class president
Without Jackie O
And I'm singing 'Happy Birthday'
Like Marilyn Monroe

One, this is not a school girl crush, no
Two, this is not puppy love, uh-uh
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

One, this is not a school girl thing, no
Two, what about the diamond ring? Uh-uh
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
Calendar pin-up queen in platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose
Golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snack
A Veuve Clicquot and Ho Ho's
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it home
While I'm singing for the soldiers
Like Marilyn Monroe

One, this is not a school girl crush, no
Two, this is not puppy love, uh-uh
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

One, this is not a school girl thing, no
Two, what about the diamond ring? Uh-uh
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
Baby, baby

And if I call you on the telephone
I might overdose
Cause I'm strong but I'm lonely
Like Marilyn Monroe

This is not a school girl crush
This is not puppy love
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold me and trust me, baby?

One, this is not a school girl crush, no
