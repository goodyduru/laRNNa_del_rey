400 years (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
And it's the same -
The same (wo-o-o-o) philosophy
I've said it's four hundred years;
(400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
Look, how long (wo-o-o-o)
And the people they (wo-o-o-o) still can't see.
Why do they fight against the poor youth of today?
And without these youths, they would be gone -
All gone astray

Come on, let's make a move:
(make a move, make a move. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
I can (wo-o-o-o) see time (wo-o-o-o) - time has come,
And if-a fools don't see
(fools don't see, fools don't see. Wo-o-o-o)
I can't save the youth:
The youth (wo-o-o-o) is gonna be strong.
So, won't you come with me;
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live - live a good, good life
And be free.

Look how long: 400 years, (400 years, 400 years) -
Way too long! (wo-o-o-o)
That's the reason my people (wo-o-o-o) - my people can't see.
Said, it's four hundred long years - (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
Give me patience (wo-o-o-o) - same philosophy.

It's been 400 years, (400 years, 400 years)
Wait so long! Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o.
How long? 400 long, long years. /fadeout/

The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone-a;
The stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone.

You're a builder, baby;
Here I am, a stone.
Don't you pick and refuse me,
'Cause the things people refuse
Are the things they should choose.
Do you 'ear me? Hear what I say!

Stone that the builder refuse
Will always be the head cornerstone-a;
The stone that the builder refuse, yeah! -

d. COMMA COMMA

Comma, comma, come back here,
My-y young lady;
Comma, comma, come back here to me,
My-y young lady, yeah!
Jus' while I thought
Everything was running smooth,
She left me
While I was in the mood.
Now I'm callin' to you,
But my world is relying for you to:

Comma, comma, come back here,
My-y young lady, yeah!
Comma, comma, come back here to me,
My-y young lady!
Jus' while I thought
Everything was running smooth.
You know I love you;
Oh now I love you. /fadeout/

e. DEWDROPS

Mm-mm-hm.
I've been searchin' the whole darn day
For a little woman of mine - mine - mine - mine.
Someone a-told me I could find her here,
But it seem she disappear.
Said, I searched the whole darn day;
Night is drawing nigh.
I t'ink I'd better go home;
Try tomorrow again.

But when I reached that railroad station,
I missed the last train,
And then it seemed like dewdrops
Gonna fall on me;
Yes, it seem like teardrops
Gonna call on me now.

I said, I'd better make up my mind
What am I gonna do.
Am I gonna rest up here,
Or am I gonna push on through?

My mind say, "Hey, man, ya hit the road."
Down there I missed the track - track - track;
I'm lost! Lord, I'm lost, eh!
Love is such a heavy load!

And then: for crying out loud, come back to me!
For crying out loud, hear my plea!
For crying out loud, come back to me!
Why do you treat me so bad?
Why do you treat me so bad?
Mm - mm - mm - mm - bam, bam.
Bom, bom, bome, bome.

f. STIR IT UP

Let's stir it up!
Stir it up, little darlin';
Stir it up. Yaga, yaga.
Little darlin', stir it up. Mm.
Little darlin'.

It's been a long, long time
Since I've got you on my mind, o-oh.
Now you are here
It's so clear:
See what we could do,
Just you and me, yea-eah!

Let's stir it up!
Little darlin', stir it up!
Oh, come on, woman!
Little darlin', come on! Stir it up. ...
Little darlin'.

I'll push the wood, blaze the fire;
Satisfy your heart desire.
I'll a-stir it, yeah - every minute, yeah!
All you got to do, honey, Keep it in it.

Let's stir it up!
Little darlin', let's stir it up!
Little darlin', stir it up!
Oh, wo - wo - wo - wo-ah, li'l darlin'. Lead up now.

g. I'M HURTING INSIDE

When I was just a little child,
'Appiness was there awhile.
Then from me it slipped one day:
'Appiness, come back, I say,
'Cause if you don't come - come,
I go looking, yeah! -
For 'appiness.
'Cause if you don't come - come,
I go looking now! -
For 'appiness.

Then together like school children,
Then your hurt was just in vain.
Lord, I'm your weary child:
'Appiness, come back. Oh, I -
'Cause if you don't come
Gonna go lookin', yeah! -
For 'appiness.
And if you don't come,
Gonna go lookin', yeah! -
For 'appiness.
Like Jah said, I'm a-hurtin' inside;
I'm a-hurtin' inside.

The lord named Adam and Eve,
To live a happy life.
In the garden of Eden,
But they disobeyed.

I wanna know,
Why they sin,
In the garden of Eden.

It's a devilman's affair,
In the shape of a serpent.

And they broke the fruit of life
And everyone of us is living in sin.

Any anywhere you go,
Woman is the root of all evil.

He was the first one to break a fruit
And everyone of us is living in sin.
