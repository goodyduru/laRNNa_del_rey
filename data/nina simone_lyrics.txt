Now listen honey while I say
How can you fix your mind to say you're going away

Don't say that we must part
Don't break my aching heart
You know you love me
True for many years
Love me night and day
Can't you see my tears
How can you leave me
Listen while I say

After you've gone and left me crying,
After you've gone there's no denying,
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad,
You'll miss the greatest mama that you ever ever ever had.
There'll come a time, don't you forget it,
There'll come a time when you'll regret it.

Some day when you grow lonely,
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only,
After you've gone, after you've gone away

After you've gone and left me crying,
After you've gone there's no denying,
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad,
You'll miss the greatest pal you ever had.
There'll come a time, don't you forget it,
There'll come a time when you'll regret it.

Some day when you grow lonely,
Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only,
After you've gone, after you've gone away
Oh yeah
After you've gone, after you've gone away

Nina simone, gilbert o'sullivan

I remember this afternoon
When my sister came into the room
She refused to say how my father was
But i knew he'd be dying soon.

And i was oh so glad, and it was oh so sad
That i realized that i despised this man i once called father.
In his hanging on, with fingers clutching
His body now just eighty-eight pounds
Blinded eyes still searching
For some distant dream that had faded away at the seams.
Dying alone, naturally.

I was his favourite child, i had him a little while
Just as long as i could play the piano and smile a little smile
Just when i needed him most, he was already a ghost
And for all my life there where promises and they always have been broken

Leaving me alone with all my troubles
Not ever once touching me and saying
"daugther, i'll help you get over."
Now he's fadig away and i'm glad to say,
He's dying at last. naturally.

It's a very sad thing to see that my mother with all her heart
Believes the words that the bible said "til death do us two part".
For her that was forever and ay, he decided her night and day
How could some english words so small affect someone so strangely?

Taking her away from us, her soul included
She might es well be gone with him, all the children are excluded.
Loneliness is hell, i know so well,
For i'm alone. naturally.

I waited three weeks for him to die
I waited three weeks for him to die
Every night he was calling on me
I wouldn't go to him.
I waited three weeks for him to die
Three weeks for him to die.

And after he died, after he died
Every night i went out, every night i had a flight.
It didn't matter who it was with
'cos i knew what it was about.
And if you could read between lines, my dad and i close as flies.
I loved him then and i loved him still, that's why my heart's so broken.

Leaving me to doubt god in his mercy
And if he really does exist then why does he desert me?
When he passed away i smoked and drank all day,
Alone. again. naturally.

Chip Taylor

There'll be no strings to bind you hands
Not if my love can't bind your heart
And there's no need to take a stand
For it was I who chose to start
I see no need to take me home
I'm old enough to face the dawn

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)
Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Then slowly turn away from me

Maby the suns light will be dim
But it wont matter anyhow
If mornings echo says we've sinned
Well it would what I wanted now
And if we're victims of the nght
I won't be blinded by the light

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)
Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Then slowly turn away, I wont beg you to stay with me, me

Through the tears, of the days, of the years
Baby, Baby, baby

Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)
Just call me angel of the morning (angel)
Just touch my cheek before you leave me (baby)

Angelo Badalamenti, John Clifford

Old people talk to themselves
When they sit all 'round all day
This old woman I knew
I used to go over there and sit with her
And she'd be sitting around
In a rocking chair talking to herself

And she used to say she used to say
Sometimes the cold gets in my bones so bad
Till I just don't think I can go
Yeah and for a little while well I don't care
If my days are coming to an end
And just as soon be gone sometimes

Sometimes the night comes down on me
And I know what's ahead
An evening in this cold old house
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed
An evening in this cold old house
With no one to say goodnight to me when I go to bed

Sometimes
I wonder why I stay
What am I waiting for
My children are grown and gone away
They got children of their own now
Don't need me anymore

In winter when the streets are bare
There ain't nothing much to see
I just can't help missing and thinking
About that kindly man
That one old winter time came
And took away from me

And then one morning
Another spring is there outside my door
Things are blooming
Birds are singing
And suddenly yes well I ain't sad
Ain't sad no more ain't sad no more

When it's warm and the sun is out
It's like my heart's restored
I've had my love I've had my children
And I have so many memories
So don't mind me complaining
What the years may bring

Cos this old world has been fine with me really
And I'm thankful for seeing another spring
It's gonna be better this time another spring
It's gonna be groovier this time another spring
It's what's happening this time
So I'm thankful for letting me see another spring

I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue
I've been waiting each day
For someone exactly like you

Why should I spend some money
On a show or two
When nobody sings these love songs
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
You make me understand 
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
Baby you make me understand 
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Yes she knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

Langston Hughes, Nina Simone

Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash
Just who do think I am
You raise my taxes, freeze my wages
And send my son to Vietnam

You give me second class houses
And second class schools
Do you think that alla colored folks
Are just second class fools
Mr. Backlash, I'm gonna leave you
With the backlash blues

When I try to find a job
To earn a little cash
All you got to offer
Is your mean old white backlash
But the world is big
Big and bright and round
And it's full of folks like me
Who are black, yellow, beige and brown
Mr. Backlash, I'm gonna leave you
With the backlash blues

Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash
Just what do you think I got to lose
I'm gonna leave you
With the backlash blues
You're the one will have the blues
Not me, just wait and see

(1963) Bob Dylan

Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin fallin' down

You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don't know how to smile

Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
Your baby's eyes look crazy
They're a-tuggin' at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there's anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you ain't a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder
It's pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It's pounding on your brain
Your wife's screams are stabbin' you
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass it is turning black
There's no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There's no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That's hangin' on the wall

Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can't seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you're holdin' in your hand

There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
There's seven breezes a-blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean's pounding roar

There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There's seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There's seven new people born

Traditional

There is a balm in Gilead
To make the wounded whole

If you can preach like Paul
Go home and tell your loved ones
He died to save us all

Beat-up little seagull
On a marble stair
Tryin' to find the ocean
Lookin' everywhere

Hard times in the city
In a hard town by the sea
Ain't nowhere to run to
There ain't nothin' here for free

Hooker on the corner
Waitin' for a train
Drunk lyin' on the sidewalk
Sleepin' in the rain

And they hide their faces
And they hide their eyes
'Cause the city's dyin'
And they don't know why

Oh, Baltimore
Man, it's hard just to live
Oh, Baltimore
Man, it's hard just to live, just to live

Get my sister Sandy
And my little brother Ray
Buy a big old wagon
Gonna haul us all away

Livin' in the country
Where the mountain's high
Never comin' back here
'Til the day I die

Oh, Baltimore
Man, it's hard just to live
Oh, Baltimore
Man, it's hard just to live, just to live

Anthony Newley, Leslie Bricusse

Red is the color of a lot of lollipops,
Orange is any orange on a tree.
Yellow's the color of a bag of lemon drops,
Green is a piece of seaweed in the sea.

Blue is the color of the sky in summertime
Indigo is a Siamese cat's eyes.
Violet's the color of a flow'are in wintertime.
These are the colors of the rainbow skies.

There is a beautiful land
Where all your dreams come true;
It's all tied up in a rainbow,
All shiny and new;
But it's not easy to find
No matter what you do.

It's not on top of a mountain
Or beneath the deep blue sea
Or in London zoo or in Timbuktoo,
Or in Timbuckthree.

And if you travelled the world
From China to Peru,
There's no beautiful land on the chart.
An explorer could not begin
To discover it's origin
For the beautiful land is in your heart.

Traditional

Black is the color of my true love's hair
His face so soft and wondrous fair
The purest eyes

And the strongest hands
I love the ground on where he stands
I love the ground on where he stands

Black is the color of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair
Of my true love's hair

Oh, I love my lover
And well he knows
Yes, I love the ground on where he goes
And still I hope

That the time will come
When he and I will be as one
When he and I will be as one

So black is the color of my true love's hair
Black is the color of my true love's hair
Black is the color of my true love's hair

Traditional

Black is the color of my true love's hair
His face is like roses so fair
He's the prettiest face
And the neatest of hands
I love the ground on where he stands

Oh I love my love
And this he knows
I love the ground on whereon he goes
If you no more on earth I see,
I can't serve you as you have me

The winters passed and the leaves are green
The time is passed that we have seen
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I will be as one

I go to the Clyde to mourn and weep,
But satisfied I never could sleep
I write you a letter
Just a few short lines
I'll suffer death ten thousnad times.

So fare you well my ain true love
The time has passed but I wish you well
But still I hope the time will come
When you and I wil be as one.

I love my love and this she knows
I love the ground whereon he goes
He's theprettiest face and the neatest of hands,
I love the ground wereon he stands.

(1947) Gian Carlo Menotti

The sun is falling and it lies in blood
The moon is weaving bandages of gold
Old Black Swan where oh where is my lover now
Where oh where is my lover now

Torn and tattered is my bridal gown and my lamp is lost
With silver needles and with silver threads
The stars stitch a route for the dying sun
Old Black Swan where oh where is my lover now

I had given him a kiss and a golden ring
And a golden ring
I had given him a kiss of fire and a golden ring
Oh with silver needles and with silver threads
The stars stitch a route for the dying sun

Black Wing o Black Wing take me down with you
Take me down with you take me down with you
Take me down with you
Old Black Swan take me down with you
I had given him a kiss of fire
Take me down with you

Herbert Sacker, Nina Simone

Why you wanna fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly
No place bif enough for holding all the tears you're gonna cry
Cos your mama's name was lonely and your daddy's name was pain
And they call you little sorrow cos you'll never love again

So why you wanna fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly
You ani't got no one to hold you you ain't got no one to care
If you'd only understand dear nobody wants you anywhere
So why you wanna fly Blackbird you ain't ever gonna fly

Gordon Jenkins, Joe Bishop

Let me cry, let me sigh
When I'm blue
Let me go way from this lonely town

Won't be long for my song
Will be thru
Cause I know I'm on my last go-round

All the love I could steal beg or borrow
Wouldn't heal all this pain in my soul
What is Love but a prelude to sorrow
With heartache ahead for your goal

Here I go, now you know
Why I'm leaving
Got the Blues, What can I lose.... Good-bye.

Irving Berlin

Blue skies smiling at me
Nothing but blue skies do I see

Bluebirds singing the song
Nothing but bluebirds all day long

I never saw the sun shining so bright
Never saw things going so right
Noticing the days hurrying by
When you're in love, my, how they fly

Blue days all of them gone
Nothing but blue skies from now on

Abbey Lincoln, Nina Simone

Hey Lordy mama
I heard you wasn't feeling' good
They're spreadin' dirty rumors
All around the neighborhood
They say you're mean and evil
And don't know what to do
That's the reason that he's gone
And left you black and blue
Hey yeah
Tell me what you gonna do now

They say he's left you all alone
To weather this old storm
He's got another woman now
Hangin' on his arm, yeah yeah yeah
That old fool's tellin' everybody
He's sick and tired of you
Hey Lordy Lordy mama
What you gonna do
Hey yeah
Tell me what you gonna do

They say you love to fuss and fight
And bring a good man down
And don't know how to treat him
When he takes ya on the town
They say you ain't behind him
And just don't understand
And think that you're a woman
But actin' like a man
Hey Lordy mama
What you gonna do now

Get your nerves together, baby
And set the record straight
Set it straight
Let the whole round world know
It wasn't you
That cause his bitter fate
All these years you loved him
And he knows it's true
'Cause what you're wantin'
For your man
Is what he's wantin', too
Hey yeah
Tell me what you gonna do now

When you love a man enough
You're bound to disagree
'Cause ain't nobody perfect
'Cause ain't nobody free
Hey Lordy mama
Tell me what you gonna do
What you gonna do

Break down and let it all out
Break down and let it all out

I've held back my tears
Just as long as I could
But now my eyes can see
It's all over for you and me
And holding back ain't gonna do no good

I'm gonna break down and let it all out
Break down and let it all out

I've hidden my heart too many times before
Now my aching heart knows that we're apart
And I can't hide it anymore

So I'm gonna break down and let it all out
Break down and let it all out

I remember when you used to love me and oh how sweet it was...
But it's not enough just to remember, 'cause
What good is the past?
Once upon a time...
All those old memories can set my heart at ease
So before I loose my mind... Yeah

I'm gonna break down and let it all out
Break down and let it all out

My eyes are open and now I see it's all over for you and me
Break down and let it all out
Break down and let it all out

Now my aching heart knows that we're apart
Break down and let it all out
Break down and let it all out

All those old memories can set my heart at ease
Break down and let it all out
Break down and let it all out...

And I want you to walk down freedom's road
You little Brown Baby

Till your daddy and you mama protect you

When out of men's heart all hate is hurled

Brown eyed handsome man
Arrested on charges of unemployment,
He was sitting in the witness stand
The judge's wife called up the district attorney
Said you free that brown eyed man
You want your job you better free that brown eyed man

Flying across the desert in a twa,
I saw a woman walking across the sand
She been a-walkin' thirty miles en route to Bombay.
To get a brown eyed handsome man
Her destination was a brown eyed handsome man

Way back in history three thousand years
Back every since the world began
There's been a whole lot of good women she'd a tear
For a brown eyed handsome man
That's what the trouble was brown eyed handsome man

Beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind
Between a doctor and a lawyer man
Her mother told her daughter go out and find yourself
A brown eyed handsome man
That's what your daddy is a brown eyed handsome man

Milo Venus was a beautiful lass
She had the world in the palm of her hand
But she lost both her arms in a wrestling match
To get brown eyed handsome man
She fought and won herself a brown eyed handsome man

Two, three count with nobody on
He hit a high fly into the stand
Rounding third he was headed for home
It was a brown eyed handsome man
That won the game; it was a brown eyed handsome man

Buck
You're a whole lot a man
Just take a look
At your great big hands
You know you can crush
Poor me in two
But gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do

I say I never have to worry
'Bout you goin' out
There ain't no other woman
Ain't no need to doubt
So early to bed
And early to rise
I know just what you're thinkin'
Bye the look in your eyes

I say Buck
So sweet is your back
I like to wash you
And kiss you when you're wet
So hold me close
And squeeze me till I sigh
Please love me, honey
Till the day I die

I say Buck
There ain't no other man around
Get your lover gal
To calm right down
No question 'bout the way
I feel for you
So gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do
Oh so gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do
Oh so gentle, oh so gentle
Are the things you do

Fletcher Henderson, Dixon

Pack up all my cares and woe, here I go, singing low,
Bye-bye Blackbird.
Where somebody waits for me, sugar's sweet, so is she,
Bye-bye Blackbird.
No one here can love and understand me.
Oh -- what hard-luck stories they all hand me.
Make my bed and light the light
I'll arrive late tonight,
Blackbird, Bye-bye.

Jimmy Machugh, Loesser

All day long before my eyes come little visions of you,
They shouldn't, they mustn't, but they do.
Can't get out of this mood,
Can't get over this feeling,
Can't get out of this mood,

Last night your lips were appealing,
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.
Can't get out of this dream
What a fool to dream of you,
Twasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you,
But now I'm saying it, I'm playing it dumb,
Can't get out of this mood,
Heartbreak here I come.

I can't get over this feeling,
Last night your lips were appealing,
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.
What a fool to dream of you,
To sigh and tell you that I love you,
But now I'm playing it, now I'm playing it dumb,
I can't get out of this mood,
Heartbreak, heartbreak here I come.

I left a note on his dresser
And my old wedding ring 
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing 

Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said
Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring

Don't look for me 
I'll get ahead
Remember darling 
Don't smoke in bed

Don't look for me 
I'll get ahead
Remember darling 
Don't smoke in bed

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

Perish is the word that more than applies
To the hope in my heart each time I realize
That I am not gonna be the one to share your dreams
That I am not gonna be the one to share your schemes
That I am not gonna be the one to share what
Seems to be the life that you could
Cherish as much as I do yours

Oh I'm beginning to think that man has never found
The words that could make you want me
That have the right amount of letters, just the right sound
That could make you hear, make you see
That you are drivin' me out of my mind

Oh I could say I need you but then you'd realize
That I want you just like a thousand other girls
Who'd say they loved you With all the rest of their lies
When all they wanted was to touch your face, your hands
And gaze into your eyes

Cherish is the word I use to describe
All the feeling that I have hiding here for you inside
You don't know how many times I've wished that I had told you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could hold you
You don't know how many times I've wished that I could
Mold you into someone who could
Cherish me as much as I cherish you

And I do cherish you
And I do cherish you

Cherish is the word

One for the little biddy baby, was born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you four by four,
Four for the poor that stood at the door,
Three for the Hebrew children,
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little biddy baby, was born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you six by six,
Six for the six that couldn't get fixed,
Five for the gospel preacher,
Four for the poor that stood at the door,
Three for the Hebrew children,
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little biddy baby, was born, born, born in Bethlehem.

Children go where I send you,
How shall I send you?
I'm gonna send you eight by eight,
Eight for the eight that stood at the gate,
Seven for the seven came down from heaven,
Six for the six that couldn't get fixed,
Five for the gospel preacher,
Four for the poor that stood at the door,
Three for the Hebrew children,
Two for Paul and Silas,
One for the little biddy baby, one for the little biddy baby,
One for the little biddy baby. He was born, born,......
He was born in Bethlehem.

H. Krasnow, B. Lovelock

Going where the willows weep no more, darlin' baby,
Going where the willows weep no more,
Chilly winds don't blow along my shore, oh baby,
Where the chilly winds, the chilly winds don't blow.

Going where my father waits for me, oh baby,
Going where my father waits for me,
Going there 'cause there I'd rather be, oh baby,
Where the chilly winds, the chilly winds don't blow.

Yes there will be red roses round my door, darlin' baby,
There will be red roses round my door,
Going where they'll welcome me for sure, oh baby
Where the chilly wind, the chilly wind don't blow.
Chilly winds, chilly winds, the chilly winds don't blow.

Nina Simone

Come ye ye who would have peace
Hear me what I say now
I say come ye ye who would have peace
It's time to learn how to pray

I say come ye ye who have no fear
What tomorrow brings child
Start praying for a better world
Or peace and all good things

I say come ye ye who still have hope
That we can still survive now
Let's work together as we should
And fight to stay alive

I say come ye ye who would have love
It's time to take a stand
Don't mind abuse it must be paid
For the love of your fellow man

I say come ye come ye
Who would have hope
Who would have hope
Who would have hope
Who would have hope

Paul Lawrence Dunbar, Nina Simone

Because I have loved so deeply
Because I haved loved so long
God in his great compassion
Gave me the gift of song

Because I have loved so vainly
Sung with such faltering breath
Oh, oh, oh, the Master in
His infinite mercy
Offers the boon of death

(1967) Nina Simone

And now we are one
Let my soul rest in peace
At last it is done
My soul has been released
For thousands of years
My soul has roamed the earth
In search for you
So that someday I could give birth

To know joy, joy, joy, joy
Joy and peace is mine
Peace divine
And now we give thanks
Give thanks for each other
At peace forever
For it is done

At peace forever
For we are one

If it hadn't been for cotton-eye Joe
I'd been married long time ago
Where did you come from. Where did you go?
Where did you come from cotton-eye Joe?

(Repeat)

He came to town like a midwinter storm
He rode through the fields so
Handsome and strong
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
But all he had come for was having some fun

(Repeat intro)

He brought disaster wherever he went
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
They all ran away so nobody would know
And left only men cause of cotton-eye Joe

(Repeat intro)

Tony McKay

Oh Dambala come Dambala
Oh Dambala come Dambala

Sing of the wings of a three toed frog
Eat weeds from the deepest part of sea
Bring the trumpet from Heaven
And the fire from Hell
Then nobody can break the spell

Oh Dambala come Dambala
Oh Dambala come Dambala

On the seventh day God will appear
On the seventh night satan will be there
On the seventh day God will appear
On the seventh night satan will be there

Oh Dambala,come Dambala
Oh Dambala,come Dambala

You slavers will know what it's like to be a slave
A Slave to your hearts,a slave to your head
A slave to your souls,a slave to your graves

You won't go to Heaven
You won't go to Hell
You'll remain in your graves
With the stench and the smell

Oh Dambala come Dambala
Oh Dambala come Dambala

I'll melt down your walls
I'll melt your steel guns
I'll make you dumb
I'll make you blind

Dambala send demons
Dambala send angels
Dambala send fire
Dambala send water

Oh Dambala come Dambala
Oh Dambala come Dambala

Rudy Stevenson

When you like a fellow
Try to treat him right
Give him your attention
Day and Night

When he starts to smilin'
And he's got you uptight
Shower him with kisses
Day and night

Tell him how you love him
Tell him he's out of sight
Then he'll know you dig him
Day and night

If he wants to leave you
And you think he might
Beg him not to leave you
Day and night

Tell him that you're lonely
Tell him that you're cold
Tell him that you need him
Here to (Satisfy your soul)

If he likes to dance now
Tell you what you do
When you see him comin' down the street
You start to (Do the bungaloo)

Oh no, even when he's wrong
Tell him that he's righr
You can take the blame
Both day and night

Jacques Brel, Jouannest, Eric Blau, Mort Shuman

They hold each others hands
They walk without a sound
Down forgotten streets
Their shadows kiss the ground
Their footsteps
Sing a song
Tat's ended before it's begun
They walk without a sound
The desperate ones

Just like the tiptoe moth
That dance before the flame
They burn their hearts so much
That death is just a name
And if love calls again
So foolishly they run, they run, they run
They run, they run, they run, they run
They run without a sound
The desperate ones

I know the road tey're on
I've walked their crooked mile
A hundred times or more
I drank their cup of bile
They watch their dreams go down
Be hind the settin sun
Yeh, yeh, yeh, they walk without a sound
The desperate ones

Le he who threw the stone at them
Stand up and take a bow
He knows the verb "to love"
Beu he'll never, never, never know how
On the bridge of nevermore
They disappear one by one
Disappear without a sound
The desperate ones

And underneath the bridge
The water's sweet and deep
This is their journey's end
The land of endless sleep
They cry to us for help
We think it's all in fun,
They cry, they cry, they cry, they cry
Without a sound
They disappear without a sound
They walk without a sound without a sound
Disappear without a sound
Cry without a sound
Yai, yaj, yaj, yaj, yaj, yaj, yaj
The desperate ones

Nina Simone

Do I move you, are you willin'
Do I groove you, is it thrillin'
Do I soothe you, tell the truth now
Do I move you, are you loose now
The answer better be (Yes, yes)
That pleases me

Are you ready for this action
Does it give you satisfaction
Are you hip to what I'm sayin'
If you are then let's start swayin'
The answer better be (Yes, yes)
That pleases me

When I touch you do you quiver
From your head down to your liver
If you like it let me know it
Don't be psychic or you'll blow it
The answer better be (Yes, yes)
That pleases me

(1943) Duke Ellington, Bob Russell

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
Don't you know, I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with somebody new
But does that mean that I'm been untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you

Some kiss may cloud my memory
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And baby you never will



Original lyric

Someone told someone and someone told you
But they wouldn't hurt you, not much
Sine ev'ry one spreads the story
With his own little personal touch

Do nothin' till you hear from me
Pay no attention to what's said
Why people tear the seam of anyone's dream is over my head

Do nothin' till you hear from me
At least consider our romance
If you should take the word of others you've heard
I haven't a chance

True I've been seen with someone new
But does that mean that I'm untrue?
When we're apart the words in my heart reveal how I feel about you
Some kiss may cloud my memroy
And others arms may hold a thrill
But please do nothin' till you hear from me
And you never will

Jimmy Webb

Do what you gotta do
Come on back see me when you can
Man I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start it's my own fault
What happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feels no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And man you never lied to me
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

So you just do what you gotta do
My wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss
Those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind
Find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

(B. Holiday/A. Herzog, Jr.)

Hush now, don't explain
There aint nothin' to gain
I'm glad that your back
Don't' explain

Quiet baby, don't explain
There is nothing to gain.
Skip back the lipstick
Don't explain.

You know that I love you
And what love endures
All my thoughts of you
For I'm so completley yours
Don't want to hear folks chatter
Cause I know you cheat
Right n' wrong don't matter
When your with me my sweet..

Hush now don't explain
Daon't you know your my joy and your my pain.
My life is yours love
Don't explain

Int.....

All my thoughts of you, for I'm so completley yours.
I don't want to hear nobody chatter
Cause I know you cheat,
Right n' wrong don't matter
When your with me my sweet.

Hush now, don't explain
Your my joy, your my pain
My life is yours love
Don't wxplain.

B. Benjamin/S. Marcus/C. Cadwell

Baby do you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don'tcha know that no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong you see some bad

But oh, I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

Ya know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
Then sometimes again it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has it's problems
And I get more than my share
But that's me one thing I never mean to do

Cause I love you
Oh baby
I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?

Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
Don't let me be misunderstood

I try so hard
So don't let me be misunderstood

I left a note on his dresser
My old wedding ring
With these few goodbye words
How can I sing
Goodbye old sleepy head
I'm packing you in like I said

Take care of everything
I'm leaving my wedding ring
Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed

Don't look for me
I'll get ahead
Remember darling
Don't smoke in bed

People laugh each time they see us walking by and their whispering just make
You feel like you wanna cry. Keep on walking by my side don't look behind. You
Know I love you, so don't you pay em' no mind.

People say our love ain't gonna last too long. And they point at us, just like
We've been only carry on, keep on looking in my eyes and we'll be fine. You see
I love you, so don't you pay em' no mind.

Stay with me and let em' see, let em' know that you love me, that you love me, if
It's true who cares what they do? Cause I don't need anyone but you. Just you
And me, we're gonna make it all alone. Let them laugh at us, we're gonna build
A world all our own, Keep on then, keep on holdin on to me, they'll learn in
Time. I really love you, so don't you pay em' no mind. You know I love you, you
Know I can't be without you

If I stay, I know I'm that I'ma share your love and that I couldn't take. And
If I go, we'll be apart and I know my heart would surely break. So, what
Difference does it make, which one I choose? Either way I lose.

Though I know, my love is true. I'd die if you ever told me good-bye. Ever told
Me good-bye. And I know, she loves you too. She would do, the same as I. What
Difference does it make, which one I choose? Either way I lose. Either way I
Lose. Either way I lose.

This is the end of the line
I've clearly read ever sign
The way you glance at me
Indifferently
And take your hand from mine

This is the end of the line
How can I ever be fine
How helpless I've become
I feel like some discarded valentine

Remember in the biginning
Your winning ways excited me
And all the while I was certain
That we two found a love that comes just to a few

We've reached the end of the line
I hope your dreams turn out fine
I'm awfully tired
And so I guess I'll go
Although it's only nine

But this is the end of the line
The end of the line

Lyrics in Hebrew:

ארץ זבת חלב
חלב ודבש

ארץ זבת החלב
זבת החלב ודבש

Lyrics In English:

Erets Zavat Chalav
Chalav Oodevash

Erets Zavat Hachalav
Zavat Hachalav Oodevash

Translation:

Land flowing with milk
Milk and honey

The land flowing with milk
Milk and honey

Everyone's gone to the moon

Streets full of people, all alone
Roads full of houses, never home
A church full of singing, out of tune
Everyone's gone to the moon

Eyes full of sorrow, never wet
Hands full of money, all in debt
Sun coming out in the middle of June
Everyone's gone to the moon

You see a long time ago life had begun
Everyone went to the sun

Parks full of motors, painted green
Mouths full of chocolate-covered cream
Arms that can only lift a spoon

You see everyone's gone
Everybody's gone
Everyone's gone to the moon
Everyone's gone to the moon
What will happen now
Everyone's gone to the moon
There's nobody left
Everyone's gone to the moon

Everything must change
Nothing stays the same
Everyone will change
No one, no one stays the same

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
For that's the way of time
No one, and nothing goes unchanged

There are not many things in life one can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds fly

Winter turns to spring
A wounded heart will heal
Oh but never much too soon
No one, and nothing goes unchanged

The young become the old
And mysteries do unfold
For that's the way of time
No one, and nothing stays unchanged

There are not many things in life one can be sure of
Except rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds fly

Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds fly

Rain comes from the clouds
Sun lights up the sky
Hummingbirds fly

Everything must change

Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
Minor,
Everytime we say goodbye.

When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to
Minor,
Everytime we say goodbye.

Dorothy Fields, Jimmy Machugh

I know why I waited
Know why I've been blue
I've been waiting each day
For someone exactly like you

Why should I spend some money
On a show or two
When nobody sings these love songs
Exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
You make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
Baby you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

Now I know why my mama
She taught me to be true
She knew just around the corner
Yes she knew just around the corner
Was somebody like you

Sammy lerner, frederick hollander

Falling in love again I never wanted to
What am I to do I can't help it
Love has always been my game play it how I may
I was made that way I can't help it

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again I never wanted to
What am I to do I can't help it

Men cluster to me like moths around a flame
And if their wings burn I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again I never wanted to
What am I to do I can't help it

Birds flying high you know how I feel
Sun in the sky you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by you know how I feel

(refrain:)x2
It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea you know how I feel
River running free you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel

(refrain)

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean

And this old world is a new world
And a bold world
For me

Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Scent of the pine you know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel

(refrain)

Billie Holiday

My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean
My man he don't love me he treats me oh so mean
He's the meanest man that I've ever see

My baby wears high peg pants stripes are really yellow
Baby wears high peg pants stripes area really yellow
When he starts into love me he's so fine and mellow

Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long
Love will make you drink and gamble make you stay out all night long
Love will make you do things that you know is wrong

Do right baby if you stay home every day
I'll do right baby if you stay home every day
You're so mean and evil I know you're gonna drive me away

Why did he leave me why did he have to go
Why did he leave me why did he have to go
Went off and left me baby I loved him so

I'll be a good wife to you if it means anything to you
I'll stay home every night and I'll love you
And kiss you every night and one of these days
If you're good to me honey one of these day
If God is good to me I'll bring you a little burny

Come back to me baby try me one more time
Cos without your loving I swear I'm gonna lose my mind

Folks Who Live on the Hill
((1937) Oscar Hammerstein II, Jerome Kern)

Someday we'll build a home on a hilltop high,
You and I,
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill.
And we'll be pleased to be called,
"The folks who live on the hill".

Someday we may be adding a thing or two,
A wing or two.
We will make changes as any fam'ly will,
But we will always be called,
"The folks who live on the hill".

Our veranda will command a view of meadows green,
The sort of veiw that seems to want to be seen.
And when the kids grow up and leave us,
We'll sit and look at the same old view,
Just we two.

Darby and Joan who used to be Jack and Jill,
The folks like to be called,
What they have always been called,
"The folks who live on the hill".

Lost in day to day,
Turned another way
With a laugh, a kind hello
And some small talk with friends I know
I forget that I'm not over you for a while.

A wave, an easy grin,
A smile to put them in,
Got other lives to listen to
And some music that I have to do
I forget that I'm not over you for a while.

Days go by with no empty feeling,
Until I touch my hair and touch my skin
And remember you're gone.

People say to me, "hey Nina do you need some company?
When you have some time to spend,
Drop around-you need your friends. "
They forget that I'm not over you for a while,
They forget that I'm not over you for a while.

Coots, Lewis

For all we know
We may never meet again
Before we go
Make this moment live again
We won't say goodbye
Until the last minute
I'll hold out my hand
And my heart will be in it

For all we know
This might only be a dream
We come and we go
Like the ripples, like the ripples in the stream
So baby, love me, love me tonight
Tomorrow was made for some
Oh, but tomorrow
But tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come
For all we know

For myself
I must learn for myself
Not from what someone else
Has said or done
And so I live my life
From day to day
Try to smile
While feeling my way
Just like a child

For myself
I must learn for myself
The future that some else
May say will come
May never be
What destiny holds for me
Let me see
For myself!

Oscar Brown jr

Eve and Adam had a garden everything was great
Till one day a boy says pardon Miss my name is snake
See that apple over yonder if you'll take a bite
You and Adam both are bound to have some fun tonight
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it

The Lord had said in the beginning everything is free
Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do
Teaser her man till he decided he'd just try some too
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted

I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add
And when they made a full confession the Lord said hm I see
I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
You're all indebted now you gonna get it

The Lord made Eve Adam's madam have his kids and all
Placed some labour laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it
Oh go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted
You always did it now you'll gonna get it
Forbidden fruit

My skin is black
My arms are long
My hair is woolly
My back is strong
Strong enough to take the pain
Inflicted again and again
What do they call me
My name is Aunt Sarah
My name is Aunt Sarah
Aunt Sarah

My skin is yellow
My hair is long
Between two worlds
I do belong
My father was rich and white
He forced my mother late one night
What do they call me
My name is Saffronia
My name is Saffronia

My skin is tan
My hair is fine
My hips invite you
My mouth like wine
Whose little girl am I?
Anyone who has money to buy
What do they call me
My name is Sweet Thing
My name is Sweet Thing

My skin is brown
And my manner is tough
I'll kill the first mother I see
My life has to been rough
I'm awfully bitter these days
Because my parents were slaves
What do they call me
My name is peaches

You're nothing but a dirty, dirty old man
You do your thinking with a one track mind
Keep talkin' about heaven glory but
On your face is a different story
Clean up your rap your story's getting dusty
Wash out your mouth
Your lies are getting rusty
Can't believe nothing you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you're funkIER THAN a mosquito's tweeter
You gotta mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same old game, same old thing
You never changed
Always rappin 'bout the same old thing

I got something to tell ya
I got something to tell you baby
But you ain't hip to baby
Blowin' minds is a thing of the past
You blew your chance that's why you never last
You want to be a graduate mother
But in reality just another brother
You think you slick but could
Stand a lot of greasing
The things you do ain't never really pleasin'
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you funkIER THAN a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same old game, same old thing
A...lways rappin 'bout the same old thing
You beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

You put yourself upon a big stool
Nothin' worse than an educated fool
Talkin' sex is your favorite conversation
But peace and love is a famous generation
What's in your head has really started showing
Your conversation gettin' kinda boring
Can't believe nothin' you say
'Cause I'm around and I see what you do
You know you funkIER THAN a mosquito's tweeter
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils
Same old game, same old game
Same old thing you never change
Same old game, same old thing
Always rappin' 'bout the same old thing

(1939) Irving Mills, Duke Ellington

Way down at Mister Joe's Cafe
They're takin' someone far away
And if you hear a song today
It's a sad tune that you'll be playin':
She's leavin' and folks are feelin' so low
They're grievin' and they're consolin' poor Joe
Gonna miss her song
Gonna miss her smile
She'll be travlin' alone down that last long mile
They're sighin'
With all thei trouble and woes
They're Cryin' 'cause they all loved
The gal from Joe's.

(1933) wesley " sox" wilson

Up in harlem on a saturday night
Were the highbrows get together, it's just to tight
We all gather at the harlem strut
And what we do is tut tut tut

Ol' hannah brown, from way cross town
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down

He moves me right off to sleep
Check all your razors check your guns

Look at yourself
If you had the sense of humor
You would laugh to beat the band

Look at yourself
Do you still believe the rumor
That romance is simply grand

Since you took it on the chin
You have lost that toothpaste grin
My mental state is all a jumble
I sit around and sadly mumble

Fools rush in, so here I am
Very glad to be unhappy
I can't win
But here am I 
More than glad to be unhappy

Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad

Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad

Unrequited love's a bore
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad

Like a straying baby lamb
With no mammy and no pappy
I'm so unhappy
But oh, so glad

Alex Comfort, Nina Simone

Oh Daughter, dear Daughter,
Take warning from me
And don't you go marching
With the N-A-A-C-P.
For they'll rock you and roll you
And shove you into bed.
And if they steal your nuclear secret
You'll wish you were dead.

(refrain:)
Singin too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.
Singin too roo la, too roo la, too roo li ay.

Oh Mother, dear Mother,
No, I'm not afraid.
For I'll go on that march
And I'll return a virgin maid.
With a brick in my handbag
And a smile on my face
And barbed wire in my underwear
To she'd off disgrace.

(Refrain)

One day they were marching.
A young man came by
With a beard on his cheek
And a gleam in his eye.
And before she had time
To remember her brick...
They were holding a sit-down
On a nearby hay rig.

(Refrain)

For meeting is pleasure
And parting is pain.
And if I have a great concert
Maybe I won't have to sing those folk songs again.
Oh Mother, dear Mother
I'm stiff and I'm sore
From sleeping three nights
On a hard classroom floor.

(Refrain)

One day at the briefing
She'd heard a man say,
"Go perfectly limp,
And be carried away. "
So when this young man suggested
It was time she was kissed,
She remembered her brief
And did not resist.

(Refrain)

Oh Mother, dear Mother,
No need for distress,
For the young man has left me
His name and address.
And if we win
Tho' a baby there be,
He won't have to march
Like his da-da and me.

Now if your mind lies in the Devil's workshop
And evil duens your thrill
And trouble and mischief is all you live for
You know darn well
That you'll go to hell

So you're living high and mighty
Rich off the fat of the land
Just don't dispose of your natural soul
Cause you know darn well
That you'll go to hell

I say hell
Where your natural soul burns
Hell
Where you pay for your sins
Hell
Keep your children from wrongdoing
Cause you know darn well
That they'll go to hell.

I say hell
Man, woman were created
Hell
To live for eternity
Hell
With an apple they ate from the tree of hate
So you know darn well
That they went to hell

Now Satan was an angel in heaven
But he stirred up trouble and woe
So the lord commanded that the Devil be branded
So you know darn well
He went to hell
Yeah, he went to hell
Yeah, he went to hell
He went to hell.

From the depths of slumber,
As I ascend the spiral stairways of wakefulness,
I will whisper:
God! God! God!

Thou art the food, and when I break my fast
Of nightly separation from Thee,
I will taste Thee, and mentally say:
God! God! God!

No matter where I go, the spotlight of my mind
Will ever keep turning on Thee;
And in the battle din of activity, my silent war-cry will be:
God! God! God!

When boisterous storms of trials shriek,
And when worries howl at me,
I will drown their noises, loudly chanting:
God! God! God!

When my mind weaves dreams
With threads of memories,
Then on that magic cloth will I emboss:
God! God! God!

Every night, in time of deepest sleep,
My peace dreams and calls, Joy! Joy! Joy!
And my joy comes singing evermore:
God! God! God!

In waking, eating, working, dreaming, sleeping,
Serving, meditating, chanting, divinely loving,
My soul will constantly hum, unheard by any:
God! God! God!

Oh stairs... You look so high tonight
Climbin' up with all my might
Where I got no heart to be
'Cause he ain't comin' home no more.

Oh room... I'm all alone with you
Tell me what's a women to do
When her man is gone
And he ain't comin' home no more.

I'm all choked up... Inside me
Try'na hold back my tears
You know... I just can't get used
I just can't used to this loneliness
How am I gonna face the empty years.

Oh chair... Oh chair
You sittin' silent there
Don't you even care
That my baby's gone... Yea, yea
And he ain't comin' home no more

Yes... For my baby's gone
And he ain't comin' home no more

He needs me
He doesn't know it, but he needs me
And so no matter where he goes
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm there

He needs me
I ought to leave him, but he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his and I'm here
And I'm gonna be his friend or his lover

'Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover
That he needs me
I've got to follow where he leads me
Or else he'll never know that I need him
Just as he needs me

Lorenz Hart, Richard Rodgers

He was too good to me how can I get along now
So close he stood to me
Everything is all messed up and wrong now
My baby would have brought me the sun
Cos making me smile that was his fun

When I was mean to him he didn't say go away now
You see I was his queen to him
Who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural that I'm blue
Cos my baby was too good to be true

I said he was too good to me how am I ever get along now
So close he stood to me
Everything's all messed up and wrong now
He would have brought me the sun and the moon
Cos anytime I left him it was too soon

When I was mean to him he didn't say go away now
I was his queen to him who's gonna make me gay now
It's only natural said it's only natural that I'm so blue
He was too good to be true

(1956) Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington

Buddy Bolden tune up
Blowing horn was his game
Born with a silver trumpet in his mouth
He played the horn before he talked
Born on the after beat
He patted his foot before walked

When Buddy Bolden tuned up you could hear him clean
Clean across the river clean across the river
He woke up the working people and kept the easy living
Call on Buddy Bolden call him Buddy Bolden

Watch it he's calling his flock now
He's calling his flock now here they come
Call him Buddy Bolden he's calling his flock now
Here they come here they come
Come on Buddy Bolden here they come

There is a house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, I'm one

If I had only listened of what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But bein' so young and foolish, my Lord
Let a gambler lead me astray

Now, my mother is a tailor
She sews those new blue jeans
And my sweetheart is a drunkard, Lord
Drinks down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a drunken man needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Lord, is when he's on the drunk

Somebody go get my baby sister
Tell her to do, not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call it the Rising Sun

Well, I'm goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
Yes, I'm goin' back to spend my life
Beneath, beneath, the rising sun

No one seems to care as much
No time to smile, laugh or cry as much
Have we lost the touch that means so much
Have we lost the human touch

No one wants to be alone
To walk or talk and sleep and weep alone
Have we lost the touch that does so much
Have we lost the human touch

Touch me now and let me know
Hold me tight so I can go
Through this misery unafraid
And really knowin' what life is all about

No one wants to live alone
Who wants to smile, laugh or cry alone
Have we lost the touch that means so much
Have we lost the human touch
Yes, yes, yes

Hush, little baby, don't say a word,
Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

And if that mockingbird don't sing,
Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring.

And if that diamond ring turn brass,
Papa's gonna buy you a looking glass.

And if that looking glass gets broke,
Papa's gonna buy you a billy goat.

And if that billy goat don't pull,
Papa's gonna buy you a cart and bull.

And if that cart and bull turn over,
Papa's gonna buy you a dog named Rover.

And if that dog named Rover won't bark.
Papa's gonna to buy you and horse and cart.

And if that horse and cart fall down,
Well you'll still be the sweetest little baby in town.

Bennie Benjamin, Sol Marcus

I who never had much I now have a treasure
A love too great to measure
I am blessed with happiness
And I'm done with loneliness

I who walked all alone not really knowing
Till now just where I was going
I am blessed because this day
You came show me the way

Till now I was like a grain of sand
Lost on a lonely beach
Yes till now I could never understand
That this was within my reach

I who cried to the moon see only sunshine
Because darling you're mine
I am blessed with wealth untold
A love worth more than gold

(1967) Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb

I walk the lonely streets; I watch the people passing by.
I used to smile and say hello. I guess that that was just a happy gap.
Then you happened, girl, this feeling that posessses me.
I just can't move myself. I guess it all just had to be.

I can't see nobody... No, I can't see nobody.
Mine eyes can only look at you... You.

I used to have a brain; I used to think of many things.
I watched the falling rain and listened to the sweet birds sing.
Don't ask me why, little girl. I love you and that's all I can say.
You're ev'ry, ev'ry breath I take. You are my nights; my night and day.

(chorus...)

Every single word you hear... Is coming from this heart of mine.
I never felt like this before... A love like yours so young and fine.
And now as I try to forget you... It doesn't work out any way.
I loved you such a long time ago... But in my eyes you'll always be.
Every single word you hear... Is coming from this heart of mine.
I loved you such a long time ago... Don't know why...
And I don't know why... Baby...

(chorus...)
(chorus...)

(1952) hoagy carmichael

I get along without you very well
Of course, i do
Except when soft rains fall
And drip from leaves then i recall
The thrill of being sheltered
In your arms
Of course, i do
But i get along without you very well

I've forgotten you
Just like i said i would
Of course, i have
Or maybe except when i hear your name
Someone's laugh that's just the same
I've forgotten you just like
I should

What a guy
What a fool am i
To think my aching hearth
Could keep the moon
What's in store
Should i phone once more
No, no, no, no, no
It's best that i stick to my tune

I said that i get along
Without you very well
Of course, i do
Except perhaps in spring
But then i should never
Ever think of spring
For that would
Surely break my heart in two

(1941) paul francis webster, duke ellington

My baby ever treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!

My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Like alonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Original lyric

The poets say that all who love are blind
But I'm in love and I know what time it is!
The good book says " go seek and ye shall find"
Well, I have sought and my what a climb it is!
My life is just like the weather
It changes with the hours
When he's near I'm fair and warmer
When he's gone I'm cloudy with showers;
In emotion, like the ocean it's either sink or swim
When a woman loves a man like I love him.
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way he should;
I got it bad and that ain't good!

My poor heart is sentimental not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
But when the weekend's over and monday rolls aroun'
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out
He don't love me like I love him nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Like alonely weeping willow lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good!
And the things I tell my pillow no woman should
I got it bad and that ain't good!
Tho folks with good intentions tell me to save my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about him I can't live without him
Lord above me make him love me the way he should
I got it bad and that ain't good!

Angelo Badalamenti, John Clifford

I hold no grudge
There's no resentment und'neath
I'll extend the laurel wreath and we'll be friends
But right there is where it ends

I hold no grudge
And I'll forgive you your mistake
But forgive me if I take it all to heart
And make sure that it doesn't start again

Yes I'm the kind of people
You can step on for a little while
But when I call it quits
Baby that's it
I'm the kind of people
You can hurt once in a while
But crawling just ain't my style

I hold no grudge
Deep inside me there's no regrets
But a gal who's been forgotten may forgive
But never once forget

(1947) Duke Ellington

I like the sunrise cos it brings a new day
I like the new day it brings new hope they say
I like the sunrise blazing in the new sky
Nighttime's so weary and oh so am I

Every evening I wish upon a star
That my brand new tomorrow isn't very far
When that heavy blue curtain on night
Is high in the sky way out of sight

I like the sunrise so heavenly to see
I like the sunrise and I hope it likes poor me

Baker, Hayton

I love to love
Wnat plenty of love each night
Say I love to love it's so good it can't be right

I don't want a man with Harvard of Yale degrees
Because I don't intend to play information please
Just squeeze me or baby you gonna freeze me
You've got to Romeo me make feel like I'm Salomè

Don't want a man to sit there and talk too much
I just need a guy with a Frank Sinatra touch
Cos I'm tired of all the times I felt
Like a piece of butter about to melt
I wanna press your lips against mine
I wanna feel lightning tickle my spine
I want what there can never to be too much of
Yes I love to love

Just squeeze me or baby you gonna freeze me
When the iron is hot strike it
Hold me I like it I like it

Don't want a man to sit there and talk too much
I just need me a guy with a Frank Sinatra touch
Just build me an earthquake as fast as you can
I got me a hobby and my hobby is men
He's what I intend to build my collection of
Because I love to love

I Love Your Lovin' Ways when you hold my hand
And with a little ssqueeze you make me understand
That I'm the only one underneath the sun for you, yes, for you
I L Y L W, yes, I L Y L W, yes I do.

I L Y L W when you kiss a kiss
The way you pop it up makes me go for this
Because it makes me feel I'm the only one you need, yes, you need

Oh yeah, your kisses make taste so good
Oh daddy, tell me, darling, you're not made of wood.

I L Y L W when you hold me tight
You're always good to me and you treat me right
So baby take my love 'cause it's made you, just you
I L Y L W oh I L Y L W yes I do...

(1935) Ira Gershwin, Dubose Heyward, George Gershwin

I loves you, Porgy,
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
And I'll be glad

Yes I loves you, Porgy,
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
With his hot hands
If you can keep me
I wants to stay here with you forever
I've got my man

I loves you, Porgy,
Don't let him take me
Don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
I've got my man

Someday I know he's coming to call me
He's going to handle me and hold me
So, it' going to be like dying, Porgy
When he calls me
But when he comes I know I'll have to go

I loves you, Porgy,
Don't let him take me
Honey, don't let him handle me
And drive me mad
If you can keep me
I wanna stay here with you forever
I've got my man

By Jay Hawkins
Performed by Marilyn Manson:
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine.
I can't stand the things that you do.
No, no, no, I ain't lyin'. No.
I don't care if you don't want me
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.
Yeah, I'm yours, yours, yours.
I love you. I love you.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I put a spell on you.
Lord! Lord! Lord!
....'Cause you're mine, yeah.
I can't stand the things that you do
When you're foolin' around.
I don't care if you don't want me.
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.
Yeah, yours, yours, yours!
I can't stand your foolin' around.
If I can't have you,
No one will!
I love you, you, you!
I love you. I love you. I love you!
I love you, you, you!
I don't care if you don't want me.
'Cause I'm yours, yours, yours anyhow.

They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
So I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere inside these walls

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be released

Yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
Man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him hollering so loud
Just crying out that he's not to blame

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now any day now
I shall be relased

I sing just to know that I'm alive
I play just to feel that I'll survive
And if there's a second place
Where?????????? Just the case
I sing just to know that I'm alive

Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose, Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose, Sugoose, Yeah Sugoose

Well the mountains they won't move no they don't
And the people they won't dance and they won't
I sing, I sing, I sing, I sing,
I sing just to know that I'm alive.

(1968) Randy Newman

Broken windows and empty hallways
A pale dead moon in the sky streaked with gray
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles
With frozen smiles to chase love away
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

Lonely, lonely
Tin can at my feet
Think I'll kick it down the street
That's the way to treat a friend

Bright before me the signs implore me
To help the needy and show them the way
Human kindness is overflowing
And I think it's going to rain today

I wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
For the whole round world to hear

I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
That every man should be free

I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
I wish that I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue I'd be starting anew

Well I wish I could be like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Oh I'd soar to the sun and look down at the sea
And I'd sing cos I'd know that
And I'd sing cos I'd know that
And I'd sing cos I'd know that
I'd know how it feels to be free
I'd know how it feels to be free
I'd know how it feels to be free

Cross, Cory

I'll look around
And when I've found me somebody who laughs like you
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear

So I'll look around
Sweetheart and when I've found me somebody
Somebody who laughs like you
I'll know this love that I've been dreaming of
And it won't be the old love that I always knew

Mmm who laughs like you
I know somewhere spring must fill the air with sweetness
Just as rare as a flower that you gave me to wear

So I'll look around
And when I've found me somebody who laughs like you
I'll know this love that I've been dreaming of
And it won't be the old love that I always knew

I'm going back home where I was born
First I planned to stay but I can't live this way
I'm going back home where I was born

Try to understand I think this city's grand
But with all it's charme give me the little country farm
I'm going back home where I was born

Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah now oh yeah
I tell you all about it I think you ought to know
Tell you all about it why I wanna go

I miss the country preacher and the house of prayer
I miss the bootlegger smelling in the air
Miss friendly faces and the country smiles
The crickets singing you can hear it for miles

Miss the rooster crowing at the break of dawn
Yes it all happens where I was born
Miss the fried chicken colored greens
Miss the hot biscuits and the lima beans
Miss the prayer meeting where the people pray
With the drum beating till the break of day

You can have it you can have it
You can have it you can have it
You can have thy town I won't be around
This here life's too fast but 'll never never last

I'm going back home where I was born
I got to go home got to go home
Where the people are real people can feel
Got to go down got to go down
Leave here today on my way so long so long
Going back home going back home
Got to go home got to go home
Got to go home got to go home
Where I where I was born

Rudy Stevenson

I'm gonna leave you yes I'm gonna
I'm gonna leave you cos I wanna
And I'll go where people love me
And I'll stay there cos they love me

No more headaches no more heartbreaks
I'm gonna leave you where I met you
I'm gonna leave you whit your money
I want somebody to call me honey

I don't want gold rings
I wanna hear sweet things
I need affection and not protection
When you're teasing you should be squeezing

I'm gonna leave you where I met you
Yes I'm pulled up with your person
And I'm pulled up with your person
And I waited getting frustrated

I'm old fashioned I want my passion
So I'm leaving though I'm grieving
I'm gonna leave you where I met you

I'm gonna leave you
When you're teasing you should be squeezing
I'm gonna leave you

I'm gonna leave you cos I'm gonna
Yes I'm gonna leave you cos I wanna
And I'll go where people love me
And I'll stay there cos they love me

No more headaches no more heartbreaks
I'm gonna leave you where I met you
I'm gonna leave you whit your money
I want somebody to call me honey

I don't want gold rings
I wanna hear sweet things
I need affection and not protection
When you're teasing you should be squeezing

I'm gonna leave you where I met you
Yes I'm pulled up with your person
And I'm pulled up with your person
And I waited getting frustrated

I'm old fashioned I want my passion
So I'm leaving though I'm grieving
I'm gonna leave you where I met you

I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name

But I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name
So I told Him it would be alright and the world would hate me
That I would go hungry if He changed my name

Leo Robin, Ralph Rainger

If I should lose you
The stars would fall from the skies
If I should lose you
The leaves would wither and die

The birds in Maytime
Would sing a lonely refrain
And I would wander around
Hating the sound of rain

With you beside me
No wind in winter would blow
With you beside me
A rose would bloom in the snow

I gave you my love
But I was living a dream
And living would seem in vain
If I lost you

Nina Simone

If you knew how I missed you
You would not stay away today
Don't you know I need you
Stay here my dear with me

I need you here my darling
Together for a day a day
Together never parting
Just you just me my love

I can't go on without you
Your love is all I'm living for
I love all things about you
Your heart your soul my love

I need you here beside me
Forever and a day a day
I know whatever betides me
I love you I love you I do

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Rien n'est jamais acquis Г  l'homme. Ni sa force
Ni sa faiblesse ni son cЕ"ur. Et quand il croit
Ouvrir ses bras son ombre est celle d'une croix
Et quand il croit serrer son bonheur il le broie
Sa vie est un Г©trange et douloureux divorce

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Sa vie elle ressemble Г  ces soldats sans armes
Qu'on avait habillГ©s pour un autre destin
A quoi peut leur servir de se lever matin
Eux qu'on retrouve au soir dГ©sarmГ©s incertains
Dites ces mots ma vie et retenez vos larmes

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Mon bel amour mon cher amour ma dГ©chirure
Je te porte dans moi comme un oiseau blessГ©
Et ceux-lГ  sans savoir nous regardent passer
RГ©pГ©tant aprГЁs moi les mots que j'ai tressГ©s
Et qui pour tes grands yeux tout aussitфt moururent

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Le temps d'apprendre Г  vivre il est dГ©jГ  trop tard
Que pleurent dans la nuit nos cЕ"urs Г  l'unisson
Ce qu'il faut de malheur pour la moindre chanson
Ce qu'il faut de regrets pour payer un frisson
Ce qu'il faut de sanglots pour un air de guitare

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux

Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne soit Г  douleur
Il n'y a pas d'amour don't on ne soit meurtri
Il n'y a pas d'amour don't on ne soit flГ©tri
Et pas plus que de toi l'amour de la patrie
Il n'y a pas d'amour qui ne vive de pleurs

Il n'y a pas d'amour heureux
Mais c'est notre amour Г  tous deux

(1964) Nina Simone, Waring Cuney

She does not know
Her beauty,
She thinks her brown body
Has no glory.
If she could dance
Naked,
Under palm trees
And see her image in the river
She would know.
But there are no palm trees
On the street,
And dishwater gives back no images.

Lil Green

In the dark
It's just you and I
Not a sound
Ther's not one sigh
Just the beat of my poor heart
In the dark

Now, in the dark, in the dark
I get such a thrill
When he presses his fingertips
Upon my lips
And he begs me to plase keep still
In the dark

But soon
This dance will be endin'
And you're gonna be missed
Gee, I'm not pretendin'
'Cause I swear it's fun
Fun to be kissed

In the dark
Now we will find
What the rest
Have left behind
Just let them dance
We're gonna find romance
Lord, in the dark

Traditional

In the evening by the moonlight
When my mother had finished working
We used to sit around the fire place
Till the cornbread it was done
And then we all would eat our supper
After that we'd clean the kitchen
It's the only time they ever gave us to spare
To have a little fun
Then my daddy used to take his fiddle down
That hung upon the wall
While the silvery moon was shining clear and bright
How the folks would enjoy it
They would sit all night and listen
As we used to sing in the evening by the moonlight

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear banjos ringing
You could hear them by the moonlight
You could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it
She would sit all night and listen
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear folks all singing
In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it
She would sit all night and listen
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah

In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear banjos ringing
In the evening by the moonlight
You could hear my folks all singing
How my mother she would enjoy it
She would sit all night and listen
As we sang in the evening by the moolight oh yeah

(1966) Barry Gibb

In the morning when the moon is at it's rest,
You will find me, at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight;
Pools of water ice cream cold light, in the morning.
Yeah yeah yeah
Its the morning of my life.

In the daytime I will meet you as before.
You will find me at the?(pool) waiting by the ocean floor,
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that nobody understands,
In a morning.
Its the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life

In the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the ev'ning I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
Where w'll stay till the sun shines
Another day lay on clothes lines
I'll be yawning
It is the morning of my life
The morning of my life

Isn't it a pity
You don't know what I'm talking about yet
But I will tell you soon
It's a pity

Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a shame
Yes, how we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain

How we take each other's love
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to remember
Just forgetting and no thank you
Isn't it a pity

Some things take so long
But how do I explain
Why not too many people can see
That we are all just the same
We're all guilty

Because of all the tears
Our eyes just can't hope to see
But I don't think it's applicable to me
The beauty that surrounds them
Child, isn't it a pity

How we break each other's hearts
And cause each other pain
How we take each other's love
The most precious thing
Without thinking anymore

Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to keep open our door
Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity

Some things take so long
But how do I explain
Isn't it a pity
Why not too many people
Can see we're all the same

Because we cry so much
Our eyes can't, can't hope to see
That's not quite true
The beauty that surrounds them
Maybe that's why we cry
God, isn't it a pity

Lord knows it's a pity
Mankind has been so programmed
That they don't care about nothin'
That has to do with care
C-a-are-e

How we take each other's love
The most precious thing
Without thinking anymore
Forgetting to give back
Forgetting to keep open the door

But I understand some things take so long
But how do I explain
Why not too many people
Can see we're just the same

And because of all their tears
Their eyes can't hope to see
The beauty that surrounds them
God, isn't it a pity
The beauty that surrounds them
It's a pity

We take each other's love
Just take it for granted
Without thinking anymore
We give each other pain
And we shut every door

We take each other's minds
And we're capable of take each other's souls
We do it every day
Just to reach some financial goal
Lord, isn't it a pity, my God
Isn't it a pity, my God
And so unnecessary

Just a little time, a little care
A little note written in the air
Just the little thank you
We just forget to give back
Cause we're moving too fast
Moving too fast
Forgetting to give back

But some things take so long
And I cannot explain
The beauty that surrounds us
And we don't see it
We think things are just the same
We've been programmed that way

Isn't it a pity
If you want to feel sorry
Isn't it a pity
Isn't it a pity
The beauty sets the beauty that surrounds us
Because of all our tears
Our eyes can't hope to see

Maybe one day at least i'll see me
And just concentrate on givin', givin', givin', givin'
And till that day
Mankind don't stand a chance
Don't know nothin' about romance
Everything is plastic
Isn't it a pity
My God.

When your guy has got his hat
And made himself hard to find
It doesn't mean you should go crazy
If it be's that way sometime
Find yourself another love
Who will treat you good and kind
Return the love he gives to you
It also be's that way sometime

Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby

When you think you've found a love
And you have peace of mind
Somebody else steals his heart
Yes it also be's that way sometime

Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does now
Baby, yes it does
Baby

Don't let the problems of this world
Drive you slowly outta your mind
Just smile look at the problem and say
It be's that way, be's that way sometime

Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does
Baby, yes it does now
Baby, yes it does
Baby, oh.....
It also be's that way sometimes

Irving mills, duke ellington

What good is melody, what good is music
If it ain't possessin' something sweet
It ain't the melody, it ain't the music
There's something else that makes the tune complete

It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
It makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm ev'rything you got
It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing

Choir:
Doo do do, do do do-oo do, do do
Doo do do, do do do
Doo do do, do do do-oo do, do do
Doo do do, do do do

It don't mean a thing, if you can't swing
Dooa doa doa – doa doa doaa
Well, it don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is sing
Dooa doa doa – doa doa doaa

Makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or hot
Give that rhythm ev'rything you've got

It don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is swing
Dooa doa doa doaa

Choir:
It don't mean a thing, if you ain't got that swing
Piano
It don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is sing
Piano
Makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or hot
Piano
It don't mean a thing, no, it don't mean a thing
Piano

It don't mean a thing, if you ain't got that swing
Yeah, doa, ooh, doa, ooh doa, oyeah
It don't mean a thing, all you gotta do is swing
Well, doa, ooh doa, ooh doa (doa doa)

Makes no diff'rence if it's sweet or hot
Give that rhythm ev'rything you've got

It don't mean a thing, if you can't swing
It don't mean a thing, if you can't sing

Sing your song, all day long
All the time, right on time
Ev'ry day, ev'ry way
Makes no diff'rence, sweet or hot
Give that song, all you got
Sing it, sing it
Doa, doa, o yeah, doa, allright, o yeah
Sing the song, all day long
Doaa, o yeah

(1945) Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II

The things I used to like, I don't like any more,
I want a lot of other things I've never had before,
It's just like my mamma says, I sit around and mourn
Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing I'm adored

I'm as restless as a willow in a windstorm,
I'm as jumpy as a puppet on a string,
I'd say that I had spring fever,
But I know it isn't spring.

I'm as starry eyed and gravely discontented,
Like a nightingale without a song to sing.
Oh, why should I have spring fever,
When it isn't even spring?

I keep wishing I were somewhere else,
Walking down a strange new street,
Hearing words I have never never heard,
From a man I've yet to meet.

I'm as busy as a spider spinning daydreams,
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing,
I haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud,
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing,
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way,
That it might as well be spring,
It might as well be, might as well be,
It might as well be spring.

I really can't stay
But baby it's cold outside
I've got to go 'way
But baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice.

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
Put some music on while I pour.

The neighbors might think
But baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat your hair looks swell.

I oughta say no no no sir
Mind if I move a bit closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride
I really can't stay
Oh baby don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

I simply must go
But baby it's cold outside
The answer is No
Ooh baby it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm.

My sister will be suspicious
My your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious
Well maybe just a half-a-drink more
Never such a blizzard before.

I've got to get home
But baby you'd freeze out there
Say lend me a coat
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
Your eyes are like starlight now*
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get over that old doubt,
Ah, but it's cold outside
Baby it's cold outside

It's cold out side.
It's cold out side.

Oh yeah, yeah
Ain't that bad, ain't that black, ain't that fine, yeah
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine.

Sunday after meetings and Saturday with a man
Sweet potato pie when you eat from the pan
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine
Ain't that bad and ain't that black and ain't that fine.

Can you dig it?
Dancing the latest dance and eating ribs and tips
Digging all the new sounds and drinking gin in sips
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine, baby
Ain't that bad, ain't that black, ain't that fine
I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul.

I could go for a ride on your sweet jelly roll
But I wouldn't give nothing for my juicy, juicy soul
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine
Ain't that bad and ain't that black and ain't that fine
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Wrapping myself in black and still I shine and glow
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine
Ain't that bad, ain't that black and ain't that fine.

True love seed in the autumn ground.
True love seed in the autumn ground.
Where will it be found?

True love deep in the winter white snow.
True love deep in the winter white snow.
How long will it take to grow?

You know true love buds in the April air.
You know true love buds in the April air.
Was there ever a bud so fair?

True love blooms for the world to see.
True love blooms for the world to see.
Blooms high upon the July tree.

(1960) Jule Styne, Adolph Green, Betty Comden

Let's go

Just in time you found me just in time
Before you came my time was running low
I was lost them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
Your love came just in time you found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day

Just in time

Before you came my time was running low oh baby
I was lost them losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you're here now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt or fear I've found my way
Your love came just in time you've found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day

Bob Dylan

I take
Just like a woman
Yes I do
And I make love
Just like a woman
And I ache
Just like a woman
But I break
Like a little girl

Nobody here feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
And no one has to guess
That baby's got new clothes
Lately I see her ribbons and her bows
And the problems
From her curls

Refrain
I take
Just like a woman...

It was raining from the first
And I was dying her of thirst
That's why I came here
And a long time's curse
And what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here
Ain't it clear
Ain't it clear

I must admit
I believe it's time for me to quit
And until we meet again
Bein' introduced as friends
Please don't let on
That you knew me when
I was hungry
And it was your world

Refrain
I take
Just like a woman....

____________________________
Original lyric by Bob Dylan

Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand here in the rain.
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls.

She takes just like a woman.
She makes love just like a woman.
And then she aches just like a woman.
But she breaks just like a little girl.

(break:)
It raining at first, and I was dying there of thirst,
So I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse
Is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here.
Ain't it clear...

That I just can't fit.
I believe it's time for us to quit.
But when we met again and are introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry, and it was your world.

You take just like a woman.
You make love just like a woman.
And then you ache just like a woman.
But you break just like a little girl.

Bob Dylan

When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on rue morgue avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess out of you

Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend my doctor
Won't even say what it is I have got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

Up on housing project hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them
Are to be what they claim
If you're looking to get silly
You better go back from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same

Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
Hew they blackmailed the sergeant at arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking like a ghost

I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough

(1930) Val, Dale, Kalmanoff, Ward, Enzo Fusco, Rodolfo Falvo

Just say that I need him as roses need the rain
And tell him that without him my dreams are all in vain
Just say I love him loved him from the start
And tell him that I'm yearning to say what's in my heart
Just say that I need him as roses need the rain
Tell him that without him my dreams are all in vain

If you should chance to meet him anytime anyplace anywhere
Say I was a fool to leave him
Tell him how much a fool can care
And if he tells you he's lonely now and then
Just won't you tell him that I love him
And want him back again

If you should see him anytime anyplace anywhere
Tell him I was a fool to leave him
Tell him how much a fool can care
And if he tells you he's lonely now and then
Won't you just say I love him and want him back again
Won't you just say I love him and want him back again

I'm the keeper of the flame
My torch of love lights his name
Ask no pity about my shame
I'm the keeper of the flame

Played with fire and I was burned
Gave a heart but I was spurned
All this time how I have yearned
Just to have my love returned

Years have passed by
And the spark still remains
True love can't die
It smolders in flames
When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

Years have passed by
And the spark still remains
True love can't die
It smolders in flames
When the fire is burning out
And the angels call my name
Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

Dying love will leave no doubt
That I'm the keeper of the flame

I'm the keeper of the flame

Oh, he was a lord of high degree
And she was a lass from the low countree
But she loved his lordship so tenderly.
Oh sorrow, sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God

One morn when the sun was on the mead
He passed by her door on a milk white steed
She smiled and she spoke, but he paid no heed
Oh sorrow, sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God

If you be a lass from the low countree
Don't love of no lord of high degree
They haint got a heart for sympathy
Oh sorrow, sing sorrow
Now she sleeps in the valley where the wild flowers nod
And no one knows she loved him but herself and God

Thomas Moore, Nina Simone

'Tis the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone
All her lovely companions are faded and gone.
No flower of her kindred, no rose bud is nigh
To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh.

I'll not leave thee, thou lone one! To pine on the stem
Since the lovely are sleeping, go sleep thou with them
'Thus kindly I scatter thy leaves o'er the bed
Where thy mates of the garden lie scentless and dead.

So soon may I follow, when friendships decay
And from love's shining circle the gems drop away
When true hearts lie wither'd and fond ones are flown
Oh! Who would inhabit this bleak world alone!

It's not 'cause I wouldn't,
It's not 'cause I shouldn't,
And, you know though well, it's not 'cause I couldn't,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

My poor heart is achin'
To bring home the bacon,
And if I find myself alone and forsaken,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

Though I'm more than willing to learn
How these gals get so much extra money to burn,
Every proposition I just turn it down,
'Way down,

It's not 'cause I wouldn't,
It's not 'cause I shouldn't, honey,
And, you know, that it's not 'cause I couldn't,
It's simply because I'm the laziest gal in town.

I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you, let it be me

Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be?

So, never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always, let it be me

So, never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always, let it be me

My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me

Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
My baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Liberace's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me

James Shelton

I lost myself on a cool damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in it's recipe
It makes me see what I want to see...
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because It brings me back you...

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that he coming to me nearly here?

Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that he, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac Wine, I feel unready for my love...

Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart

Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do
Old girl you're through
Sit there, count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue.

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

Won't you just sit there
Count the little raindrops
Falling on you
'Cause it's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use old girl
You might as well surrender
'Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue

There's a few more lonesome cities that I'd like to see
While the want of wanderlust is still inside of me

There's a few more handsome men that I'd like to know
Just a few more handsome men is down the road I go

Maybe when I have seen it all
Seen all there is to see
I find out I still can not
Run away from me

Just as long as trains keep running
Restless woman I'll be
And there's a few more lonesome cities that I'd like to see

Hey now
Maybe when I have seen it all
Seen all there is to see
I find out I still can not run away from me
Just as long as trains keep running
Restless woman I will be
And there's a few more lonesome cities that I'd like to see
Just a few more lonesome cities that I'd like to see

Burt Bacharach - Hal David

The look of love is in your eyes
A look your smile can't disguise
The look of love
Is saying so much more than these words could ever say
And what my heart has heard, well it takes my breath away

I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you, now that I have found you
Don't ever go

You've got the
Look of love, it's on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start of so many nights like this
Let's take a lover's vow and then seal it with a kiss

I can hardly wait to hold you, feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you, now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so...

It's only human for anyone to want to be in love
But who wants to be in love in vain
At night you hang around the house and weep your heart out
And cry your eyes out and rack your brain

You say it and wonder, how anyone is wonderful as he
Could 'cause you such misery and pain
I thought that I would be in Heaven, but I'm only up a tree
'Cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain

Say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
Night-time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue

Saaay, I want your love, don't wanna borrow
Have it today to give back tomorrow
Your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else

Say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night-time the right time for kissing
Night-time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else

There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intend to be independently blue

Say I want your love, don't wanna borrow
Have it today to give back tomorrow
Your love is my love
My love is your love
There's no love for nobody else

Love o'love o'love o'love
Say love o'love o'love o'love
I had a love so pure so strong
I keep wondering just where my love went wrong
My love went wrong

I say why oh why won't love free me
Why o why won't love love free me
Oh untie my hands unchain my feet
And set my poos ol' body free

I... Why must love keep me a slave oh
Why why must love keep me a slave
I can't help myself I ain't got no friends
It will take me take me straight to my grave
Love will take me straight to my grave

Chorus:
I have been a rover, I have walked alone,
Hiked a-hundred highways, never found a home.
Still in all I'm happy, the reason is, you see,
Once in a-while along the way, love's been good to me.

There was a girl, in denver, before the Summer storm.
Oh her eyes were tender, oh her arms were warm.
And she could smile away thunder, kiss away the rain,
And even though she's gone away, you won't hear me complain.

Chorus

There was a girl, in Portland, before the Winter chill.
We used to go a-courting, along October hill,
And she could laugh away the dark clouds, cry away the snow,
It seems like only yesterday as down the road I go.

Chorus

You'll always find me near a man with a horn
Find me there from dark until dawn
That's a place where music is born so fine

Just listen while he takes his solo apart
Watch him close his eyes from the start
Hear that music pour from his heart so fine

So sweetly he plays and he says it so well
Completely up under his spell

So if you're in the mood for music and love
Just forget the stars up above
For you'll find you'll be drawn
To the man with the horn
To the man with the horn
To the man with the horn

Marriage Is For Old Folks
Mort Shuman, Leon Carr
I love dancing
Crazy romancing
Fellas advancing constantly
Marriage is for old folks
Old folks, not for me!
One husband
One wife
Whaddya got?
Two people sentenced for life!
I love singing
Good healthy clinging
Quietly bringing on a spree
Marriage is for old folks
Cold folks!
One married he
One married she
Whaddya got?
Two people watchin' tv!
I'm not ready
To quit bein' free
And I'm not willing
To stop being me
I've gotta sing my song
Why should I belong
To some guy who says
That I'm wrong?
Doo doo dooo
De doo de doo
De-doo de-doo
Doo doo doo
Dooo
Cookin' dinner
Lookin' no thinner
Gray elbows and
A sudsy sea
Marriage is for old folks
Cold folks,
And it's not for me!
One husband
One wife
Whaddya got?
Two people sentenced for life!
I'm exploding
With youth and with zest
Who needs corroding
In some vulture's nest?
I've gotta fly my wings
Go places, do things
My freedom bell's really
Gonna ring!
Doo doo dooo....(etc.)
I've been through years
Too many blue years
Now I want New Year's every eve
Marriage is for old folks
Marriage is for cold folks
One husband
One wife
Whaddya got?
Two people sentenced for life
Marriage is for old folks
Marriage is for cold folks
Not for me
Can't you see
Marriage ain't for me

Memphis in June
A shade veranda under Sunday blue sky
Memphis in June
And my cousin Miranda she's making a blueberry pie

I can see the clock outside a ticking and a tocking
Everything so peaceful and dandy
I can see my grandmama 'cross the street still a rocking
Watching all the neighbours go by oh my

Memphis in June
Sweet oleander blowing perfume in the air everywhere
Up jumps the moon to make it so much grander
It's paradise honey take my advice honey
Cos there's nothing loke old Memphis in June

Duke Ellington

Merry mending to you
Merry mending merry mending
May your convalescence be fun as you chat about prevention

Merry mending merry mending
Think you're lucky you are the one
To get all of that attention
Forget about your pills forget about your ills
Forget about the bills
Get up get out get well again
Merry mending health and happiness blending
Merry mending to you

Merry mending merry mending
May your convalescence be fun as you chat about prevention
Merry mending merry mending
Think you're lucky you are the one
To get all of that attention

Forget about your pills forget about your ills
Forget about the bills
Get up get out get well again
Merry mending merry mending merry mending
Merry mending merry mending to you

(1963) Nina Simone

The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam
And I mean every word of it

Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

Can't you see it
Can't you feel it
It's all in the air
I can't stand the pressure much longer
Somebody say a prayer

Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

This is a show tune
But the show hasn't been written for it, yet

Hound dogs on my trail
School children sitting in jail
Black cat cross my path
I think every day's gonna be my last

Lord have mercy on this land of mine
We all gonna get it in due time
I don't belong here
I don't belong there
I've even stopped believing in prayer

Don't tell me
I tell you
Me and my people just about due
I've been there so I know
They keep on saying "Go slow!"

But that's just the trouble
"do it slow"
Washing the windows
"do it slow"
Picking the cotton
"do it slow"
You're just plain rotten
"do it slow"
You're too damn lazy
"do it slow"
The thinking's crazy
"do it slow"
Where am I going
What am I doing
I don't know
I don't know

Just try to do your very best
Stand up be counted with all the rest
For everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

I made you thought I was kiddin' didn't we

Picket lines
School boycotts
They try to say it's a communist plot
All I want is equality
For my sister my brother my people and me

Yes you lied to me all these years
You told me to wash and clean my ears
And talk real fine just like a lady
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie

Oh but this whole country is full of lies
You're all gonna die and die like flies
I don't trust you any more
You keep on saying "Go slow!"
"Go slow!"

But that's just the trouble
"do it slow"
Desegregation
"do it slow"
Mass participation
"do it slow"
Reunification
"do it slow"
Do things gradually
"do it slow"
But bring more tragedy
"do it slow"
Why don't you see it
Why don't you feel it
I don't know
I don't know

You don't have to live next to me
Just give me my equality
Everybody knows about Mississippi
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Mississippi Goddam

That's it for now! See ya' later

(1930) Barney Bigard, Duke Ellington, Irving Mills

You ain't never been blue, no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh
Go along blues

I always get that mood indigo
Since my baby said goodbye
And in the evening when the lights are low
I'm so lonely I could cry
For there's nobody who cares about me
I'm just a poor fool that's bluer than blue can be
When I get that mood indigo
I could lay me down and die

You ain't never been blue, no, no, no
You ain't never been blue
Till you've had that mood indigo
That feeling goes stealing down to my shoes
While I just sit here and sigh
Go along blues

Kurt Weill, Bertolt Brecht

Show us the way to the next whiskey bar
Don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Or if we don't find the next whiskey bar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die

Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey... You know why

Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey... You know why

Show us the way to the next dollar
Don't ask why
For we must find the next little dollar
Or if we don't find the next little dollar
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die

Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have dollar or you know why

Oh Moon of Alabama
We now must say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have dollar or you know why

Oh show us the way to the next little girl
Oh don't ask why
For we must find the next little girl
Or if we don't find the next little girl
I tell you we must die
I tell you we must die
I tell you
I tell you
I tell you we must die

Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
We must have little girl or you know why

Oh moon of Alabama
It's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
We must have little girl or you know why

(1945) Mack Gordon, Harry Warren

The more I see you,
The more I want you.
Somehow this feeling
Just grows and grows.
With every sigh I become more mad about you,
More lost without you,
And so it goes.
Can you imagine
How much I'll love you
The more I see you
As years go by?
I know the only one for me can only be you.
My arms won't free you;
My heart won't try.

I knew a man Bojangles
And he danced for you
In worn out shoes
With silver hair, a ragged shirt
And baggy pants, the old soft shoe
He jumped so high, he jumped so high
Then he lightly touched down

I met him in a cell in New Orleans
I was down and out
He looked at me to be the eyes of age
As he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life
He laughed, slapped his leg a step

He said his name, Bojangles
And he danced a lick across the cell
He grabbed his pants
In fettered stance
Oh, he jumped up high
Then he clicked his heels
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

He danced for those
At minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years
How his dog and him traveled about
His dog up and died, he up and died
After 20 years he still grieves

He said I dance now
At every chance in honky tonks
For drink and tips
But most of the time
I spend behind these county bars
Cause I drinks a bit

He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask him
Please, please

Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles, dance!

Don't you realize, Mr. Smith?
Don't you realize what thirty dollars buy today?
Just some stockings, and that's it.

I came from Havanah
My mother was wild as you are
She often said to me
My child, don't sell yourself
For just a dollar or two
If you end up like me
God bless you, child
So think it over
For that little  money
You give to me, Mr. Smith

There is music for lovers
It to be found
In the sound
Of a sigh.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams
Of a child.
When the whole world discovers
That love's the only thing worthwhile.
Then there'll be music for everyone
And the whole world will smile.

In the willow tree
Made for you and me
There's a silver symphony of birds.
When the poets rhyme
In the summer time
You'll hear melodies
In the words.

There is music for lovers
It to be found
In the stream
Running wild.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams
Of you child.
When the whole world discovers
That love is the only thing worthwhile
There'll be music for everyone
And the whole world will smile.

(1928) Gus Kahn, Walter Donaldson

My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see
My baby don't care who knows
My baby just cares for me

Baby, my baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
He cares for me
My baby don't care
For cars and races
My baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Liberace's smile
Is something he can't see
Is something he can't see
I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for
My baby just cares for me

Original lyrics

My baby don't care for shows
My baby don't care for clothes
My baby just cares for me
My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for high-tone places

Liz Taylor is not his style
And even Lana Turner's smile
Is somethin' he can't see

My baby don't care who knows it
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for shows
And he don't even care for clothes
My baby just cares for me

My baby don't care for cars and races
My baby don't care for
He don't care for high-tone places

I wonder what's wrong with baby
My baby just cares for
Just says his prayers for
My baby just cares for me

Judy Collins

Original lyrics by Judy Collins

My father always promised me
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance

We lived in Ohio then
He worked in the mines
On his dreams like boats
We knew we would sail in time

All my sisters soon were gone
To Denver and Cheyenne
Marrying their grownup dreams
The lilacs and the man

I stayed behind the youngest still
Only danced alone
The colors of my father's dreams
Faded without a sound

And I live in Paris now
My children dance and dream
Hearing the ways of a miner's life
In words they've never seen

I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
As it sets in my father's eyes again

My father always promised us
That we would live in France
We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance

I sail my memories of home
Like boats across the Seine
And watch the Paris sun
As it sets in my father's eyes again

George Gershwin, Dubose Heyward

My man's gone now
Ain't no use a listenin'
For his tired footsteps
Climbin' up the stairs

Old man sorrow's
Come to keep me company
Whisperin' beside me
When I say my prayers
When I say my prayers

He come around
He come up, he come around
Ain't that I mind workin'
Workin' means travelers
Journeyin' together
To the promised land

But old man sorrow
Mountin' all the way with me
Tell' me that I'm old now
Since I lose my man
Since I lose my man

Since I lose my man

(1968) Jacques Revaux, Claude Franзois, Gilles Thibault, Paul Anka

And now, the end is near and so I got to face
The final curtain, girl
Friends I say clear and state her case of which I'm uncertain
I've lived a life that's full of travelled each and every highway
And more, much more than this, I did it my way

Yeah, regrets, I've had a few
But then again, who feel to me uncertain.
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
I planned each other course, each careful footstep along the byway,
Yeah, and more, much more than this,
I did my way

Yes, there were times, I'm sure you know
When I did all much more than I could do
But threw it all, when there was doubt, on everyday
And it's not enough, I faced it all
And as big as all did my way.

Oh, I've laughed and cried, had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside, counted also music
To think like the old lad
And may I say not in a sky away,
Oh, no no no, You're not me, I did it my way.

What is a man, what have he got
If not himself, and he had not to may the things
He truly feels not words of one for use
With that shows, I took the blows and did it my way!

Original French lyric

Je me lГЁve et je te bouscule
Tu n'te rГ©veilles pas
Comme d'habitude
Sur toi je remonte le drap
J'ai peur que tu aies froid
Comme d'habitude
Ma main caresse tes cheveux
Presque malgrГ© moi
Comme d'habitude
Mais toi
Tu me tournes le dos
Comme d'habitude
Alors je m'habille trГЁs vite
Je sors de la chambre
Comme d'habitude
Tout seul je bois mon cafГ©
Je suis en retard
Comme d'habitude
Sans bruit je quitte la maison
Tout est gris dehors
Comme d'habitude
J'ai froid
Je relГЁve mon col
Comme d'habitude

Comme d'habitude
Toute la journГ©e
Je vais jouer
A faire semblant
Comme d'habitude
Je vais sourire
Comme d'habitude
Je vais mвЊ¦г"Ігґme rire
Comme d'habitude
Enfin je vais vivre
Comme d'habitude

Et puis
Le jour s'en ira
Moi je reviendrai
Comme d'habitude
Toi
Tu seras sortie
Et pas encore rentrГ©e
Comme d'habitude
Tout seul
J'irai me coucher
Dans ce grand lit froid
Comme d'habitude
Mes larmes
Je les cacherai
Comme d'habitude

Comme d'habitude
MвЊ¦г"Ігґme la nuit
Je vais jouer
A faire semblant
Comme d'habitude
Tu rentreras
Comme d'habitude
Je t'attendrai
Comme d'habitude
Tu me souriras
Comme d'habitude

Comme d'habitude
Tu te dГ©shabilleras
Comme d'habitude
Tu te coucheras
Comme d'habitude
On s'embrassera
Comme d'habitude

Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit déjà
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
A savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
A coups de pourquoi
Le coeur du bonheur

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Ou il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'après ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumière
Je ferai un domaine
Ou l'amour sera roi
Ou l'amour sera loi
Ou tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants-là
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs coeurs s'embraser
Je te raconterai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est para"t-il
Des terres brulées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai là
A te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et à t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Near to you, near to you
Even though you're far away
So near to you, always near to you
As near as april is to may
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair
Staring at the fireplace?
Oh so near to you, always near to you
Even now it seems we're face to face
But it is just if though I was standing before you
Telling you how much I adore you
If I'm really dear to you, near to you
We may be far apart and yet
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart
How near to you can I get
(2x)

Oh so near to you, always near to you
As near as april is to may
Can't you feel me there, in my favourite chair
Staring at the fireplace?
Oh so near to you, always near to you
Even now it seems we're face to face
But it is just if though I was standing before you
Telling you how much I adore you
If I'm really dear to you, near to you
We may be far apart and yet
If I'm in your heart, really in your heart
How near to you can I get?

How near to you can I get?
How near to you, can I get?

I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.


Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now  to Thy service,
By the power of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine

Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side


My soul look up with a steadfast hope,
My will be lost in Thine

So draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To the cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
To Thy precious, bleeding side

There's a new world commin'
And it's just around the bend
There's a brand new mornin'
That belongs to you and me
A nwe world commin'
The one we had vision of
And it's commin' in peace
Is commin in joy
And commin in love... Yea... Yea... Yea
There's a new world commin'
And it's just around the bend
There's a new day dawning
The one that's for you and me
A new world commin'
The one we've had vision of
And itys commin in peace
Commin' in love
Commin' in peace
Commin' in joy
And commin in peace
Commin' in joy
And commin in love
And I saw another sign in Heaven
Great and marvelous
Seven angels having the seven last plagues
For in them is filled up the Wratrh of God
And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire
And them that had gotten the victory over the beast
And over his image
And over his mark
And over his name,
Stand on the sea of glass
With the harps of God all around them.

There's a new world commin'
And it's just around the bend
There's a new day dawning

Whaaaaa, Whaaaaa,

I was born black and poor and
Now everyone Owes me.
Whaaa Whaaaa
I bad mouth the nation that set me free
And now I'm pissed cuz I can't get work
Whaaaa Whaaaa

No good man
Loving on a no good plan never treats me as he should
And that ain't good he's always bringing me down
He's no saint Heaven knows taht's what he ain't
Spends his money foolishly and not on me
I'm the one who gets the run around

I ought to hate him but still I love him so
Cos I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began tere's been other folks like me
Born to be in love with a no good man

I ought to hate him but still I love him so
Cos you see I require love that's made of fire
And in his arms I find always get that kind
No good man
Ever since the world began tere's been other folks like me
Born to be in love with a no good man

Step out in the night
When you're lonely
Listening for the sounds
That your ears don't hear

I know your cross is heavier
With every step, every step
But I know a man
And he'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are
Take a look at yourself
Take a good look at yourself

Can tell your momma
She'd only tell ya
That she told you so

The life you're leading
She won't believe
The riches of life
We all know

Dawn turns to day
And the dawning
Daytime, nighttime
And we still can't see

Why must we wait
Until the morning light
To wake up and be
Wake up and be

Wake up and be
Wake up and be
Wake up and be

Step out in the night
When you're lonely
Listen for the sounds
That your ears don't hear

I know your cross is heavier
With every step, every step
But I know a man
Who'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are
Take a look at yourself
Take a good look at yourself

Can tell your momma
She'd only tell ya
That she told you so

The life you're leading
She won't believe
The riches of life
We all know

Can tell your momma
She'd only tell ya
That she told you so

The life you're leading
She won't believe
The riches of life
We all know

When life seems full of clouds and rain
I am filled with an awkward pain
Who soothes my achin', thumpin' brain?
- Nobody

When winter comes with snow and sleet
I'm so tired with cold feet
Who says: "Here's two bits Nina honey, go and eat?"
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from nobody, no time
And until I get me somethin', yes, from somebody, sometime
Well, I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, no time

Now when winter comes all cool and clear
My friends they see me comin' near
Who says: "Come on in child and have a beer?"
- Nobody

When all day long things go amiss
I go home to find some bliss
Who hands to me a glowing kiss?
- Nobody

I ain't never done nothin' to nobody
I ain't never got nothin' from no body - no time
And until I get me somethin', from somebody, sometime
I don't intend to do nothin'
For no body, nobody, no time, no time, no body, no time!

(Jimmie Cox)

Well once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, I didn't care
Takin' my friends out for a mighty good time
Buyin' boot leg liquor, champagne and wine
Then I began to fall so low
Couldn't find me no friends
Had no place to go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it, till the eagle grins

I said nobody knows you
When you're down and out
In your pocket, you ain't got one penny
And your friends, you didn't have any
Just as soon as you get up on your feet again
Here they all come, they say that they're your long-lost friend
Oh lord without a doubt
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you
When you're down and out

I say

Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out

Well you put a lot in and you worked real hard
There were days when you tried, there were days when you stopped
Trying to please the crowd, when their unforgiving
There are easier ways to make a living

Well you've come along way since the start of things
When you've seen the joy, that hard work brings
You've made us cry, you've made us smile
Your in the front, now it's all worth while

Cause there's one day in september
We wont to remember
There isn't any doubting
We'll be in the shouting
Football's such a part of this whole town
And we know that you wont let us down

Well there's nothing better than a nice good win
There's no second prize if you let em' in
You gotta give it you best
Then give again
Out there's no such as winners friends
Well we've been our best, we've been our worst
When we do it right, well we'll come on first
Gotta get in there, and make em' sad
We'll hit em' hard, take the flag

Cause there's one day in september
We wont to remember
There isn't any doubting

And we know you wont let us down

Jesse Mae Robinson

The other woman finds time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair

The other woman enchantes her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her baby comes to call
He'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen
Cos when she's by his side
It's such a change from old routine

But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone

Sol marcus, bennie benjamin

Anytime things go wrong
Baby we'll still get along
Cos we have each other
And our love will se us through

If some tears come our way
The sun skips a day
We still have each other
And our love will se us through

Just as long as you and I
Have a little tender kiss to share
There's no doubt at all that we'll get by
Grey skies will all turn bare

So when some clouds bring the rain
We've no cause to complain
Cos we have each other
And our love will se us through
Cos we have each other
And our love will se us through

Anytime things go wrong
Baby we'll still get along
Cos we have each other
And our love will se us through

If some tears come our way
The sun skips a day
We still have each other
And our love will se us through

Just as long as you and I
Have a little tender kiss to share
There's no doubt at all that we'll get by
Grey skies will all turn bare

So when some clouds bring the rain
We've no cause to complain
Cos we have each other
And our love will see us through
Cos we have each other
And our love will see us through

Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you see me?
Papa, can you find me in the night?
Papa, are you near me?
Papa, can you hear me?
Papa, can you help me not be frightened?

Looking at the skies I see a million eyes
Which ones are yours?
Where are you now
That yesterday has waved goodbye
And closed it's doors

The night is so much darker
The wind is so much colder
The world is so much bigger
Now that I am alone

Papa, please forgive me
I know you understand me
Papa, don't you know I had no chose?
Oh, can you hear me prayin'?
Anything I'm sayin'?

Even though the night is filled with voices
I remember everything you ever
Taught me
Evey book I've ever read
Can all the words,
All the music help me face what's ahead?

The trees are so much taller
I feel so much smaller
The moon is twice as lonely
And the stars are half as bright

Daddy, how I love you
Daddy, how I need you
Daddy, how I miss you
Kissing me goodnight

(1928) Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill

You people can watch while I'm scrubbing these floors
And I'm scrubbin' the floors while you're gawking
Maybe once ya tip me and it makes ya feel swell
In this crummy Southern town
In this crummy old hotel
But you'll never guess to who you're talkin'.
No. You couldn't ever guess to who you're talkin'.

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you'll wonder who could that have been
And you see me kinda grinnin' while I'm scrubbin'
And you say, "What's she got to grin?"
I'll tell you.

There's a ship
The Black Freighter
With a skull on it's masthead
Will be coming in

You gentlemen can say, "Hey gal, finish them floors!
Get upstairs! What's wrong with you! Earn your keep here!
You toss me your tips
And look out to the ships
But I'm counting your heads
As I'm making the beds
Cuz there's nobody gonna sleep here, tonight
Nobody's gonna sleep here
Nobody!
Nobody!

Then one night there's a scream in the night
And you say, "Who's that kicking up a row?"
And ya see me kinda starin' out the winda
And you say, "What's she got to stare at now?"
I'll tell ya.

There's a ship
The Black Freighter
Turns around in the harbor
Shootin' guns from her bow

Now
You gentlemen can wipe off that smile off your face
Cause every building in town is a flat one
This whole frickin' place will be down to the ground
Only this cheap hotel standing up safe and sound
And you yell, "Why do they spare that one?"
Yes.
That's what you say.
"Why do they spare that one?"

All the night through, through the noise and to-do
You wonder who is that person that lives up there?
And you see me stepping out in the morning
Looking nice with a ribbon in my hair

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Runs a flag up it's masthead
And a cheer rings the air

By noontime the dock
Is a-swarmin' with men
Comin' out from the ghostly freighter
They move in the shadows
Where no one can see
And they're chainin' up people
And they're bringin' em to me
Askin' me,
"Kill them NOW, or LATER?"
Askin' me!
"Kill them NOW, or LATER?"

Noon by the clock
And so still at the dock
You can hear a foghorn miles away
And in that quiet of death
I'll say, "Right now.
Right now! "

Then they pile up the bodies
And I'll say,
"That'll learn ya!"

And the ship
The Black Freighter
Disappears out to sea
And
On
It
Is
Me

Earl S. Burroughs

Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
It was where everyone could see
He belonged to someone, but not me
On his hand was a plain gold band

Plain gold ring has a story to tell
It was one that I knew too well
In my heart it will never be spring
Long as he wears a plain gold ring
Oh, oh

When nighttime comes a' callin' on me
I know why I will never be free
I can't stop these teardrops of mine
I'm gonna love him till the end of time

Plain gold ring has but one thing to say
I'll remember till my dying day
In my heart it will never be spring
Long as he wears a plain gold ring
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore
Plain gold ring on his finger he wore

(1967) Robin Gibb, Barry Gibb

Many years ago I was a simple man
A simple man, no worries me;
I never lied
Please read me.

Not much conversation ever came from me,
I never saw reality;
I never tried.
Please read me.

Ah....

Maybe I've been lying on your couch too long
I'll stay if you can see me through, explain why
Please read me. Please read me. Please read me.

A child ran through the meadow on a sun drenched summer day
And then he stopped his play
And kneeled in a field of poppies.

A man walked through my ghetto on a humid summer day
And then he stopped to pay and he dealed in a field of poppies.

Oh, flower of forgetfulness, just an hour away to the moon
Take a deep breath if you are reaching for truth
While you're in the stupor
The door knocks and death takes another youth.

Poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...

A boy I used to know, a boy I used to know who's laughter rang to the skies
Was a joy to behold
Then I looked into his eyes, a look so cold, a boy who (rose on (??? Sorry))
In a field of poppies

Poppies, red poppies, red poppies, red poppies..., red poppies...,
Red poppies...., red poppies..., red poppies..., red poppies...,

Dorothy Fields, Jimmy Machugh

(1970) Hoyt Axton

You know I smoked a lot of grass,Oh Lord
And I popped a lot of pills
But I never did touch nothing
That my spirit couldn't kill
You know I see a lot of people walkin' round
Here with tombstones in their eyes
'Cause the pusher don't care
Child if you live or if you die
God damn on the pusher, yea yea
I said God damn him
God damn him, pusher man

You know the dealer
I said the dealer is a man
With lots of love racks in his hand
But the pusher is a monster
Good God, oh Lord he's my natural man
You know the dealer
The dealer takes a nickel lord
And sells you lots of sweet dreams
And lord knows we need lots a sweet dreams

But here comes the pusher
Takes your body and leaves your mind a screen
God damn on the pusher
I said God damn the pusher
He's not a natural man
You know the dealer takes a nickel
And he sells a box of sweet dreams
But he pusher takes your body
He takes your body
He takes your body
And he leaves your mind a screen
God damn him

God damn him, God damn him
God damn him, God damn the pusher
If I were the president, hear me, of this land
I'd declare totale war on the pusher man
Gimme now, now
I'd shoot him if he stands
I'd cut him if he runs yea
I'd kill him with my Bible
My razor and my gun
God damn him, God damn him
Oh, the pusher
God damn the pusher man

Norman Curtis, Oscar Brown jr

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
I heard that old rag man now making his rounds
He came right to my alley Lord with sorrowful sounds
Crying rags old iron and pulling his cart
Ask him how much he'd give me for my broken heart

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
So I asked that old rag man how much he would pay
For a heart that was broken baby when you went away
For a burnt out old love light that no longer beams
And a couple of slightly used second hand dreams

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
For those big empty promises you used to make
For those memories of you that are no longer sweet
I wish he could haul them off down the street

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
When love doesn't last tell me what is it worth

Mama's most precious possession on earth
When I asked that old rag man if he'd like to buy
He just shook his head and continued to cry

Rags old iron rags old iron
All he was buying was just rags and old iron
Rags old iron rags old iron
Rags old iron rags old iron rags old iron

Cigarette holder which wigs me
Over her shoulder, she digs me.
Out cattin' that satin doll.

Baby, shall we go out skippin?
Careful, amigo, you're flippin',
Speaks Latin that satin doll.

She's nobody's fool so I'm playing it cool as can be.
I'll give it a whirl but I ain't for no girl catching me,
Swich-e-rooney.

Telephone numbers well you know,
Doing my rhumbas with uno
And that'n my satin doll.

George Bass

See-line woman
She drink coffee

And then go home
See-line woman

See-line woman
Dressed in green
Wears silk stockings
With golden seams
See-line woman

See-line woman
Dressed in red
Make a man lose his head
See-line woman

Black dress on
For a thousand dollars
She wail and she moan

Then she sure fly away
She got a black dress on

She wail and she moan...

Darling, you always needed
And your tenderness is needed too
And it seems that I'm never tired
Loving you, loving you
Never was a feeling stronger
Aching for the sweet things you do
And it seems that I'm never tired loving you
Should the mountains crumble to ashes
And the rain should cease to fall
And if the river stopped it's flowing
You'd still be my all in all
And if the clouds cover the sky
So the sunlight won't come through
Then I will never, never, never, never, never,
Never, tire loving you

Lomax, Ledbetter

Yeah...
This is a song... Was sung by Leadbelly and it was written for... His friend...
He had a friend named Blind Lemon...
And they used to ride back and forth on a train from somewhere to Texas...
And I leraned this tune from a record
I heard by him

Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down
Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound

Take me by the hand oh babe
And lead me to the promises land

Silver City bound I'm Silver City bound
I'm gonna tell my little baby I'm Silver City bound
I'm gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down

Buddy Johnson

When you just give love
And never get love
You'd better let love depart
I know it's so, and yet I know
I can't get you out of my heart

You made me leave my happy home
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad
And it's too sad
But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do?
I'm so in love with you

I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues most every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you...

(1853) Wasserman, Aaron Neville

Oh I'm lonely and left with tears and sorrow
I can't face tomorrow since my love has gone
He's left me left me for another and my heart went with him
How can I go on

Was our love a game played for a day
Were you pretending two hearts gone astray
Am I to blame for this unhappy ending

Nothing else is left me but a memory
Beloved how I long to hold you in my arms enfold you
Live again out happiness but now I can face tomorrow alone
Since my love has gone

Artist: Nina Simone
Album: Single Woman
Song Title: Single Woman

I live alone.
That hasn't always been easy to do.
But just a single woman;
Some times as night the walls talk back to me.
They seem to say
Wasn't yesterday, a better day.

Always alone at home or in a crowd;
A single woman out on a private cloud;
Caught in a world few people understand.
I am what I am.... Only one single woman.

There was a time...I can't remember when.
The house was full of love but then again
It might have been imaginations plan,
Just to help along,
One single Woman.

Carl Nutter, Renee Borek, King Guion

Since you've gone I spend each lonely night,
Dealing out the cards from left to right,
And the King of Hearts is there to remind me
That I'm all alone playing solitaire.

Love was just another game for two,
I see now that's all it meant to you,
And my heart got lost somewhere in the shuffle,
So I'm all alone playing solitaire

In each romance there's an element of chance,
A gamble to win or to lose,
You play to win, then you find you're playing in a game with no rules,
Just made for fools.
Now, the Joker has a laugh on me,
'Cause I played my hand so carelessly,
And until you wanna share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away with solitaire.

And until you want to share that old feeling,
I'll be dealing time away, dealing time away with solitaire.

(1934) Eddie Delange, Irving Mills, Duke Ellington

In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
Filled with despair
Nobody could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love



Original lyric

In my solitude you haunt me
With reveries of days gone by
In my solitude you taunt me
With memories that never die

I sit in my chair
I'm filled with despair
There's no one could be so sad
With gloom ev'rywhere
I sit and I stare
I know that I'll soon go mad

In my solitude
I'm praying
Dear Lord above
Send back my love

There's a saying old
Says that love is blind
Still we're often told
"Seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek
A certain lad
I've had in mind

Looking everywhere
Haven't found him yet
He's the big affair
I cannot forget
Only man I ever think
Of with regret

I'd like
To add his inital
To my monogram
Tell me
Where is the shepherd
For this lost lamb?

There's a somebody
I'm longin' to see
I hope that he turns
Out to be
Someone to watch over me

I'm a little lamb
Who's lost in the wood
I know I could
Always be good
To one
Who'll watch over me

Although he may
Not be the man some
Girls think
Of as handsome
To my heart
He carries the key

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell him please
To put on some speed
Follow my lead
Oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me

(1939) Duke Ellington, Billy Strayhorn

I want something to live for
Someone to make my life an adventurous dream
Oh, what wouldn't I give for
Someone who'd take my life and make it seem
Gay as they say it ought to be

Why can't I have love like that brought to me?
My eye is watching the noon crowds
Searching the promenades seeking a clue
To the one who will someday be my
Something to live for
Something to live for
Something to live for

Richard Rodgers, Lorenz Hart

Sprinh is here
Why doesn't my heart go dancing
Spring is here
Why isn't the waltz entrancing
No desire no ambition leads me
Maybe it's becaus nobody needs me

Spring is here
Why doesn't the breeze delight me
Stars appear
Why doesn't the night invite me
But maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here I hear
Somebody told me spring is here

Nina Simone
Stars
(Janis Ian)

I was never one for singing what I really feel
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real

Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story

People lust for fame like athletes in a game,
We break our collarbones and come up swinging,
Some of us are downed
Some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found
But most have seen it all,
They live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
They always come up singing

Some make it when they're young,
Before the world has done it's dirty job
And later on someone will say
"You've had your day, now you must make way"
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned
Or the many years forgetting what you know too well
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down
You try to make amends without defending
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five
That follow as you walk and ask for autographs
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you
Some make it when they're old
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare
Or perhaps there's nothing there)

Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
But most have seen it all,
They live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
They always have a story

Some women have a body men will want to see
And so they put it on display
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance

But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day

Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze
And all you see is glory
But most have seen it all,
Who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls
And we always have a story

So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down

(1934) Benny Goodman, Chick Webb, Edgar Sampson, Andy Razaf

Savoy, the home of sweet romance,
Savoy, it wins you with a glance,
Savoy, gives happy feet a chance to dance.

Your old form just like a clinging vine,
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine,
Your cheek so soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you;

The home of sweet romance,
It wins you at a glance,
Gives happy feet a chance to dance.
Just like a clinging vine,
So soft and sweet as wine,
So soft and close to mine, divine.

How my heart is singing,
While the band is swinging,
I'm never, never, never tired of romping,
And stomping with you at the Savoy.
What joy - a perfect holiday,
Savoy, where we can glide and sway,
Savoy, let me stomp away with you;

All that I have is all that you've given me
(Ohhhh)
Did you never worry that I'd come to depend on you
(Ohhhh)
I gave you all the love I had in me
Now I find you lied and I can't believe it's true
Oooh whoa oh

You better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop

Time after time I tried to walk away
But it's not that easy
When you soul is torn in two
So I just resigned myself to it everyday yeh
And now all that I can do is to leave it up to you Ohhh

Ooh whoa oh
You better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart
Ooooh oooh oooh you better stop

Ohh ooh whoa you better stop
If you love me
Now the time to be sorry
I wont believe that you'd walk out on me baby
Ohhh yehhh
Oooh

Ooh whoa oh
You better stop (Stop)
Before you tear me apart
You better stop (Stop)
Before you go and break my heart

No whoa whoa you'd better stop stop
Oooh whoa oh
You'd better stop stop stop
You'd better stop stop

Lewis Allen, Sonny White

Southern trees
Bear strange fruit
Blood on the leaves
And blood at the roots
Black bodies
Swinging in the southern breeze
Strange fruit hangin'
From the poplar trees
Pastoral scene
Of the gallant south
Them big bulging eyes
And the twisted mouth
Scent of magnolia
Clean and fresh
Then the sudden smell
Of burnin' flesh
Here is a fruit
For the crows to pluck
For the rain to gather
For the wind to suck
For the sun to rot
For the leaves to drop
Here is
Strange and bitter crop

As sung by Billie Holiday

Southern trees bear strange fruit,
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze,
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.

Pastoral scene of the gallant south,
The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh,
Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.

Here is fruit for the crows to pluck,
For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
For the sun to rot, for the trees to drop,
Here is a strange and bitter crop.

I want a little sugar
In my bowl
I want a little sweetness
Down in my soul
I could stand some lovin'
Oh so bad
I feel so funny and I feel so sad

I want a little steam
On my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up
So they'll go
Whatsa matter Daddy
Come on, save my soul
I need some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some sugar in my bowl

You been acting different
I've been told
Soothe me
I want some sugar in my bowl
I want some steam
On my clothes
Maybe I can fix things up so they'll go
Whatsa matter Daddy
Come on save my soul
I want some sugar in my bowl
I ain't foolin'
I want some - yeah - in my bowl

(1935) Dubose Heyward, George Gershwin

Summertime and the livin's easy,
Fish are jumpin', and the cotton is high.
Oh yo' daddy's rich and yo' ma is good lookin',
So hush, little baby, don' yo' cry.

One of these mornin's you goin' to rise un singin',
Then you'll spread yo' wings an' you'll take the sky.
But till that mornin', there's a-nothin' can harm you
With Daddy and Mammy standin' by.

One more
Sunday in Savannah
Hear the whole creation shoutin'
Praise the Lord
See them flinging out the banner
While the congregation says amen

Young folk
Tendin' Sunday School
They sing merrilly 'bout the golden rule
Parsons preaching all the day
They all hollar in the righteous way

It's time for me to call on Mother Hannah
While she sits there wishing for her last reward
One more Sunday in Savannah
One more Sunday in Atlanta
It's the same thing
Same feeling

Don't ya dare
Go fishin' son
Amen

Suzanne takes you down to her place by (near) the river
You can hear the boats go by
You can spend the night forever (beside her)
And you know that she's half crazy
And (But) that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
(then) She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover
And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that she will trust you
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.

Now (And) Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said "All men will be sailors then
Until the sea shall free them"
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
'cause (And) you think maybe you('ll) can trust him
'cause (For) he's touched your perfect body with his mind.

Now Suzanne takes your hand
And she leads you to the river
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbour
And she shows you where to look
Between (Among) the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning, leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever

(1965) Andy Stroud

Don't talk just hold me closer
Let me sit on top of your knee
Go ahead and take care of business
For me for me for me

Oh Lord, don't keep me waiting
Be as firm as can be
Go ahead and take care of business
For me for me for me

In all my life no-one has touched me so close
Nor made me feel so sweet
I said to you you are God's gift to all womanhood
Take it from me take it from me

You know you know that I love you truly
And I want the whole round world to see
How you can take care of business
For me for me for me

Go take care of business for me
Yeah yeah go take care of business for me

Take me to the water
Take me to the water
Take me to the water
To be baptized

None but the righteous
None but the righteous
None but the righteous
Shall be saved

So take me to the water
Take me to the water
Take me to the water
To be, to be baptized

I'm going back home, going back home
Gonna stay here no longer
I'm going back home, going back home
To be baptized
