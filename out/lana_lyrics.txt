I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' (yeah)
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real

It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying', if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal                
                    Carry me up them stairs,
Put my white socks on,
And my pretty song, you like,
My blue nail polish.
"What is all this?", you said,
"The mess upstairs,
Don't be scared"

Daddy dearest, you know,
How I like to take trips.
Pops first stop at the K-Mart,
Buy me my peach lipgloss,
Cigarettes and lolipops,
Mad magazines, and white socks.
All in your car for,
Our trip across the usa.

We gonna party,
Like it's 1949,
We in the Pontiac,
From July to July.

It's a flower motel nation,
Day and night on our last vacation,
We gonna see it all,
Before we say goodbye.

Daddy likes Blackpool,
Pleasure beach and roadstops,
Baby likes some Swiss Apps,
Souvenir giftshops.

Late night, midnight,
Radio show talks,
Daddy, baby,
Big jail break.

Ponytail and lolipops,
Dinerettes and sodapops.
New blue bathing suite,
Ruched tops and cadillacs.

Blue lake car to dunks,
Hop skotch, shit talk,
Alabama hard knocks,
Motel dresslocks.

We gonna party,
Like it's 1949,
We in the Pontiac,
From July to July.

It's a motel flower nation,
Day and night on our last vacation,
We gonna see it all,
Before he says goodbye                
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you love

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie or
Love like you love

Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch
